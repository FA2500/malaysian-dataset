      "[{'url': 'https://vulcanpost.com/877118/najibai-chat-ai-free-financial-spending-tracker-whatsapp-malaysia/', 'title': 'Meet NajibAI, the new AI tool that helps M’sians track their expenses on WhatsApp', 'body': 'With the New Year fast approaching, it got me thinking about annual resolutions again. Some people aim to eat healthier and work out more, but for me, it’s about managing my finances better. One way I’ve been attempting to achieve this is by tracking my spending. The only problem? Manually logging in the data gets too tedious, and I end up giving up. I’ve tried apps, sheets, and even jotting it down in physical notebooks—nothing works. But I recently came across NajibAI, which could be a game changer for struggling folks like me. Created by Malaysian founder Dylan Tan, NajibAI is a chat-based WhatsApp artificial intelligence (AI) to record your receipts and track your spending. It’s one of the few free tools that Dylan’s company, Replyr.ai (a firm that helps turn WhatsApp chats into paying customers using AI), makes. “As a fun side project, I created NajibAI, a free WhatsApp tool that helps Malaysians manage their expenses,” Dylan shared with us. “It’s a tool for Malaysians, by a Malaysian, to make tracking spending easy, practical, and a bit more fun.” Anyone can try it as long as you have a WhatsApp account. All you have to do is snap a picture of your receipt, send it to your chat with NajibAI, and he’ll enthusiastically help store your records for you. Currently, NajibAI only tracks a few key elements in the receipt: Upon receiving the photo, NajibAI will extract these details from the receipt and share them with you for double-checking. This will then be stored in NajibAI’s memory bank once you’ve confirmed the details. You can also add notes to the receipt’s record for your future reference. Based on the key elements, you can request a rundown of your spending habits, which is what I personally find the most useful. For example, if you want to find out how much you’ve already spent on food this month, you can just ask NajibAI. Another nifty thing about this WhatsApp-based AI tool is that it works for receipts in any language and any currency. This makes it convenient for when you’re travelling abroad and want to stick with a set vacation budget. I was initially sceptical about this claim, but I’ve tried it with a few foreign receipts online in languages like Mandarin, Russian, and even Greek. NajibAI was able to extract all the key information without a hitch, for the most part, but it doesn’t necessarily localise the business’s name or currency used in the receipt. As the tracker is still in Beta testing, it’s not always perfect. Some occasional hiccups I’ve noticed are problems in extracting the business name (especially if it’s in a non-Latin language) and getting the total amount spent confused. The response time of the chat-based tool is also slightly slower than what I’m used to, typically averaging five to 10 seconds before replying. However, these are just minor issues that can be improved with tweaks. A bigger, more pressing concern would actually be about data and privacy since it’s a WhatsApp-based tool. To this, Dylan reassured that interacting with NajibAI is no different from messaging any other business on WhatsApp. “Everything happens within WhatsApp’s secure environment. We don’t link receipt data back to personal identities, and the system operates within WhatsApp’s privacy guidelines.” That said, he’s actively working on adding more transparency features to give users better visibility and control over their data. Just today, he rolled out a new feature allowing users to request their data to be deleted by simply asking NajibAI. “I don’t foresee significant legal issues since NajibAI operates within WhatsApp’s terms of service. However, I’m keeping a close watch on feedback and I am ready to adapt if users or other stakeholders raise concerns. The goal is to maintain trust and operate responsibly while keeping this helpful tool free for users,” Dylan stated. As for why he chose WhatsApp, it comes down to user convenience. It’s no secret that WhatsApp is a platform that many Malaysians use on a daily basis, so Dylan figured it would make the most practical sense. He believes managing expenses can feel more natural when done in a space that people already associate with communication and sharing images. That said, NajibAI is a glimpse into what’s possible with AI and plays a role in what Replyr.ai is building. Its main business focuses on automating sales on WhatsApp for businesses, using AI agents to perform actions like collecting payments, updating CRMs, and scheduling appointments. Now let’s address the elephant in the room… Why the name Najib? “I chose the name as a playful nod to Malaysian pop culture. Bossku has become part of our everyday slang, and I wanted NajibAI to feel approachable and local,” Dylan explained. “It’s just a fun, relatable way to make expense tracking more interesting.” While you may think it’s referring to a certain someone, the founder reaffirmed that there’s no explicit reference to anyone. As for legal concerns, he’s done his due diligence to ensure there’s no defamatory content or explicit association. “It’s really just [about] creating a light-hearted interaction [more] than anything else. Managing expenses is boring, but NajibAI adds a bit of Malaysian humour into the mix,” he said. This is actually one of the key lessons he learnt with his previous creation called AhBengGPT, a chat-based game powered by ChatGPT, where players try to negotiate for an iPhone from a Malaysian Ah Beng phone seller. “AhBengGPT taught me the importance of keeping interactions fun, engaging, and uniquely local. Malaysians appreciate humour and relatable touches, which is why NajibAI leans into the ‘Bossku’ term, just like how AhBengGPT would speak with really strong Malaysian slang,” he shared. To help more Malaysians manage their expenses better, Dylan intends to keep NajibAI free for everyone to use. It comes at a small cost for Replyr.ai, but he’s more interested in providing its larger benefit to more people. For now, he’s focused on learning how users interact with the AI and refining the user experience from there.

At the time of his death, he was estimated to have a net worth of US$5.1 billion according to Forbes, making him the 671st wealthiest person in the world. His wealth was primarily accumulated through his role as the founder and chairperson of Usaha Tegas, the founder of Astro Malaysia Holdings, as well as the founder of Yu Cai Foundation (YCF). A notable and forward-thinking businessman, Ananda was one of few who moved out of the old economy of oil trading and property development to the new economy of telecommunications and entertainment. Aside from Astro, his multimedia empire also includes Maxis, MEASAT, and many more. Despite his stature, Ananda Krishnan is known to be a reclusive individual, often shunning public exposure and opting for a low profile instead. As such, little is known about his personal life beyond his business. But as we celebrate his life and legacy, here are some lesser-known facts about the Malaysian businessman that have emerged over the years. Although his affinity seems to lie in business, Krishnan actually has a deep interest in politics, and actually got his Bachelors of Arts degree majoring in political science. When he became a founding director of national energy giant Petronas in the 1970s, Krishnan forged close ties with our country’s political elite, such as former prime minister Mahathir Mohamad. The businessman supposedly played a pivotal role in the development of iconic landmarks such as the Petronas Twin Towers. He apparently sold Dr Mahathir the idea of\\xa0building\\xa0the twin towers in the early 1990s. The Edge reported that Tun M then handpicked Ananda Krishnan to lead the development of the Petronas Twin Tower and the surrounding KLCC development. Krishnan was actually a follower of\\xa0Buddhism, a belief that his only son, Ven Ajahn Siripanyo, followed. Siripanyo actually made the decision to become a Theravada\\xa0Buddhist monk at the age of 18, The Economic Times reported. He is one of two children from Krishnan’s first marriage to a Thai princess. For over two decades, Ven Ajahn Siripanyo has been living as a forest monk, primarily based at the Dtao Dum Monastery near the Thailand-Myanmar border. It’s unclear who will inherit the billionaire’s wealth, but it likely would not be Siripanyo. It’s said that Krishnan first came to public prominence by helping to organise the\\xa0Live Aid\\xa0concert in the mid-1980s. Live Aid is a legendary charity concert, put together by Irish rock star Bob Geldof. A multi-venue\\xa0benefit concert,\\xa0the 1985 concert sought to raise further funds for relief of the\\xa01983–1985 famine in Ethiopia. According to Forbes, Krishnan raised US$240 million for the concert and cause. As presented in the previous point, the billionaire was quite the charitable man. Aside from Live Aid, Ananda Krishnan donated to education, the arts, sports, and humanitarian causes in Malaysia through his company Usaha Tegas, and its subsidiaries. Specifically, Krishnan’s Usaha Tegas launched the Harapan Nusantara education fund, which has sponsored 100 students a year since 2004 to attend special programmes at local private universities that collaborate with foreign universities. There’s also the Yu Cai Education Foundation with a grant of US$6.6 million to help ethnic Chinese groups. Astro also had a scholarship programme that devoted an annual RM2 million to support promising Malaysian undergraduate and graduate students studying media and broadcasting. All of these—along with numerous other initiatives, is why Krishnan was recognised on the Forbes list of Asia’s Heroes of Philanthropy in 2010. Of course, the billionaire’s life wasn’t unmarred by criticisms, having been involved in various scandals of alleged corruptions as well as reported bailout of 1MDB, among other issues. Regardless, there’s no two ways about it—Ananda Krishnan has left not just a mark on Malaysia’s business world, but on the very fabric of our nation. His businesses are household names that many of us rely on every day. His work is quite literally marked in our capital city’s skyline. His charitable efforts have impacted more lives than many of us could ever fathom. Although Krishnan was always a private figure, his acts of service greatly benefited the Malaysian public. May he rest in peace.

Not only that, but Volvo Malaysia Sdn Bhd’s (Volvo Trucks) latest range of heavy-duty trucks are also designed to revolutionise Malaysia’s logistics industry by boosting fuel efficiency and reducing carbon emissions. With a focus on safety and sustainability, the new models align with the country’s growing need for greener and safer transportation solutions. “Safety is at the heart of what we do,” Volvo Trucks Southeast Asia and Japan Managing Director Anna Engblom said in a press release. “These new trucks are engineered to protect both drivers and road users while addressing environmental challenges.” Like modern cars today, these trucks are equipped with forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking and adaptive cruise control lane-keeping support. These features aim to reduce the risks associated with heavy vehicles on Malaysia’s roads. Its new Volvo Dynamic Steering (VDS) system ensures stability under varying conditions, while an optional Camera Monitoring System (CMS) offers enhanced vision, reducing blind spots and improving night-time visibility. Malaysia’s logistics sector is thriving, ranking 26th globally in the 2023 World Bank Logistics Performance Index. Volvo’s updated trucks are tailored to the demands of this ecosystem, offering: These features could be game-changers in helping businesses deliver goods more efficiently while reducing costs and emissions. Not only that, it also aligns with Malaysia’s Low Carbon Mobility Blueprint 2021-2030, a policy framework for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the transport sector. Truck drivers are vital economic frontliners, and Volvo Trucks has also prioritised their well-being. The newly designed cabins feature: These upgrades aim to provide drivers with a productive and comfortable environment, contributing to safer and more efficient operations. Volvo Trucks is also investing in driver training to ensure operators can maximise the benefits of the new trucks. Additionally, its Iron Women Programme, launched in 2024, aims to upskill and empower women to become heavy-duty truck drivers. Five women have already graduated, with plans to train 100 women by the end of 2025. Volvo Trucks continues to set benchmarks in safety, recently earning a five-star rating from Euro NCAP for its Volvo FH and FM models. This recognition underscores its position as a leader in innovative and reliable heavy-duty truck solutions. Trucks don’t usually get the spotlight when we think about innovation or sustainability. But Volvo’s latest heavy-duty trucks might have just represented a technological leap and also a commitment to a better, greener tomorrow for Malaysia’s transport industry.

It wasn’t something that resonated with modern lifestyles.” Yet, her early interest in health remained a quiet hum in the background. Life had other plans, with Paris pursuing a career far removed from wellness. That is, until 2016, when a serendipitous discovery of Synergy Via Online (SVO)—a brand committed to simplifying health—rekindled her passion. She dove into self-learning, devouring books, attending courses, and immersing herself in the industry. “Through SVO, I realised health management could be accessible and effortless,” Paris said. The brand’s philosophy aligned perfectly with her belief that wellness shouldn’t be a burden. “I went from being an observer to an active participant. That moment marked a turning point for me,” she told Vulcan Post. It was this combination of self-taught skills and formal education that laid the foundation for Paris Queen, her health supplement brand. When Paris launched Paris Queen, she had one goal: to create a brand people could trust. “I noticed two major gaps in the health supplement market—quality and transparency,” she said. “Many products either failed to meet safety standards or didn’t disclose their ingredients clearly. It struck me how much trust was lacking in this space.” Determined to change that, Paris prioritised rigorous quality control and transparent communication. Every product carried by Paris Queen undergoes stringent testing to ensure both safety and effectiveness, and the brand shares the certifications of each product on their website. “If I wouldn’t use or recommend it myself, it doesn’t make it into our product line,” she said firmly. “We want to be synonymous with effectiveness and safety, and that’s been our guiding principle from day one.” Paris Queen has also chosen a direct-to-consumer model to ensure its customers receive the best possible experience. “Currently, our products are exclusively available online through our official website. We don’t work with any retailers at this time,” she shared. According to their website, there are 11 brands under them such as ZENSO, BIO-SERIES, Femoire and KidAone, with their primary product line coming from Wellous, a brand with nearly a decade of experience and accolades in the wellness industry. This strategic decision allows Paris Queen to maintain control over product quality and freshness while fostering a closer relationship with its customers. “By selling directly through our site, we can also offer personalised customer service and ensure that everyone who purchases from Paris Queen has a seamless and trusted experience,” she added. Launching a health supplement brand in a crowded market wasn’t easy. Paris faced stiff competition, evolving consumer demands, and logistical challenges during the pandemic. Yet, she saw these obstacles as opportunities to grow. “What kept me going was remembering why I started,” Paris reflected. “I wanted to help people manage their health effortlessly with products they could trust.” She credited her determination, along with support from SVO, for navigating these hurdles. “SVO gave me invaluable opportunities, like attending a nutritionist course in Taiwan earlier this year. It helped me provide better advice to customers and refine our product offerings.” This focus on customer-centric solutions has paid off. Paris said that her brand has built a loyal community of customers who value its commitment to quality and transparency. Beyond just selling products, Paris Queen also wants to foster a culture of wellness. The brand plans to introduce community wellness programmes including workshops, seminars, and collaborations with health professionals. “Our goal is to empower people to take control of their health,” the founder explained. “We want to make wellness feel less like a chore and more like a rewarding journey.” These programmes will cover diverse topics, from nutrition and fitness to mental health, creating a supportive space for learning and growth. As Paris Queen grows, sustainability is becoming a core focus. The brand is exploring eco-friendly practices, Paris said. “Some of the steps we’re taking include using ingredients from sustainable sources, reducing waste during production, and switching to recyclable packaging.” For Paris, her journey with Paris Queen is more than a career—it’s a calling. “Every challenge has been a lesson, and every success is a reminder of why I started,” she said. “I’m proud of what Paris Queen represents: a trusted partner in health, dedicated to making wellness simple and accessible.” With her passion and perseverance, Paris hopes to prove that health management can indeed be effortless, inspiring others to embrace a better quality of life.

This is for many reasons, including the fact that our local market was once considered the world’s worst major stock market by Bloomberg. But in recent times, Malaysia’s stock exchange markets have been looking more promising than ever. Sentiments have been shifting positively especially as tech giants, such as Google and Microsoft, announced billions of dollars in investments in Malaysia. Rakuten Trade, a leading online brokerage firm in Malaysia, shared their optimism about the country’s IPO market in a press release. This is backed up by the fact that there’s been 33 listings on the ACE Market, 10 on the Main Market, and 2 LEAP Market listings in the year. And according to the firm, the total sum is on track to hit 50 with a few more listings. Specifically, they’re referring to 4 ACE Market and 1 Main Market listings by Cropmate, Carlo Rino, Winstar, Top Vision, and TMK Chemical. This year, there’s been Main Market listings of 99 Speed Mart, Azam Jaya, and the recently listed Life Water. All of these have led to a renewed interest among retail investors. Mr Kazumasa Mise, CEO of Rakuten Trade, highlighted the strong performance of 99 Speed Mart, “99 Speed Mart was our top-traded IPO stock in 2024, attracting over 2,000 clients on listing day. This, along with strong performances from Master Tec Group, HE Group, Kawan Renergy, and UUE Holdings, demonstrates the investor appetite for quality IPOs.” Based on the draft prospectus exposure, it seems like 2025 will be another bumper year for IPOs. Rakuten Trade believes 2025 most certainly will surpass this year’s record number of IPOs. Having already achieved its KPI for IPOs in 2024, Bursa Malaysia has a target of 50 for next year. “Malaysia is now leading the market for IPOs in the region due to the attractive valuations, the conducive and supportive regulators—Bursa Malaysia, Securities Commission—the government’s clear business-centric framework, and improving fundamentals,” Rakuten Trade’s Head of Equity Sales, Vincent Lau, said. He believes that these are all key to the renewed confidence in Malaysia’s local bourse with net foreign inflows. Bernama also reported that an analyst expects Malaysia’s equity market to maintain a stable outlook in 2025, supported by robust investment inflows, strong domestic consumption, and continued fiscal consolidation. If there’s one thing that we keep hearing this year, it’s that Malaysia is on the rise. CNA reported that licensed financial advisor Lieu Ching Foo from Malaysia-based consultancy CC Advisory said that Bursa Malaysia has benefited from strong positive narratives that have been put forth by the Malaysian government. One of those narratives is the fact that Malaysia’s neutral geopolitical status is a strong advantage in today’s tumultuous climate. However, CNA also spoke to other experts who cautioned that the recovery in Malaysia’s stock market may be short-lived, considering those geopolitical tensions that are further exacerbated with the recent American election. But if local businesses and retail investors continue to put their faith in our local market, it seems like there may be a prosperous year ahead for the country.

They share our joys, comfort us in our lows, and are there for life’s big and small moments. When it’s time to say goodbye, the void they leave is immeasurable. Recognising the depth of this bond and the lack of proper avenues to grieve, Kelly Yan Yen Qun, a former architect, decided to bridge this gap. To do so, she started Piepie Pet Memorial, a haven for pet owners to bid a heartfelt farewell to their beloved companions. The idea for Piepie Pet Memorial was born out of a deeply personal experience during the Movement Control Order (MCO) in Malaysia. Kelly’s partner lost his dog, Pie, with whom he had shared an unbreakable bond for eight years. Having brought Pie from Australia to Malaysia, the dog was family. Yet, amidst the restrictions of MCO, Pie’s passing lacked the closure and dignity they wished for. “It was heartbreaking to see how much he struggled with saying goodbye,” Kelly shared with Vulcan Post. “It made me realise how little support there was for pet owners during such a difficult time. That’s when I decided we needed to do more for our furry kids.” Driven by this conviction, Kelly delved into research, looking at countries like Japan, Taiwan, and Australia, where pet funeral services were already established. With no prior experience in pet healthcare or funeral services, she looked to mentors, her entrepreneurial instincts, and sheer determination. By June 2021, as the MCO drew to a close, Piepie Pet Memorial was officially launched. While dogs and cats remain the main clientele, Piepie’s services soon expanded to accommodate a surprising variety of pets. “One day, we received a request for a farewell ceremony for a hamster,” Kelly recalled. “That’s when it hit us—every pet, no matter their size, is deeply cherished by their owners.” From hamsters to hedgehogs, parrots to turtles, and even koi fish and frogs, Piepie has honoured pets of all shapes and species. The services offered don’t discriminate by size or type. Each pet receives a dignified farewell, with pricing varying based on size. “Our philosophy is simple: All life deserves respect. Whether it’s a hamster or a gecko, their owners feel the same pain when they lose them. It’s not about the price or size—it’s about love,” she said. According to their website, pet funeral packages start at RM250, with all-inclusive options reaching RM12,999. Each package has its own set of offerings tailored to meet different needs. Piepie’s services are meticulously designed to support grieving pet owners. The journey begins when a pet owner contacts the team. Whether the pet has passed or is nearing its final days, Piepie ensures that every step is handled with empathy. According to Kelly, one of the things that sets the business apart from others is Piepie’s offerings to include personalised memorial ceremonies, where pet owners can select private or communal cremations, memorial events, or unique farewell gestures such as photo displays and tribute sessions. These ceremonies often feature meaningful touches like music, favourite toys, and paw print impressions to preserve cherished memories. In addition, Piepie provides cremation and aftercare services, addressing the environmental limitations of traditional burials. Partnering with trusted providers, Piepie ensures families receive their pet’s ashes in beautifully crafted urns or as keepsakes like memorial jewellery. Beyond the ceremonies, Piepie emphasises ongoing support for grieving families. About a week after the memorial, the team offers grief counselling to help owners process their loss. “Many owners don’t realise the depth of their grief until the ceremonies are over,” explained Kelly. “The counselling helps them navigate this emotional journey, offering closure and peace.” Operating in a field that deals with life and death daily has been an enlightening experience for Kelly and her team. They’ve witnessed the profound bonds people share with their pets and the unique ways they grieve. “Some might view pet memorial services as a luxury, but for those who see their pets as family, it’s a necessity,” the founder remarked. “This isn’t just about providing a service; it’s about giving grieving owners a chance to say goodbye without regret.” Kelly’s team approaches each case with empathy, recognising the highly emotional state of pet owners. Whether it’s a heartfelt thank-you note or a tight hug after the ceremony, these moments reaffirm the importance of their work. “There’s no greater reward than knowing we’ve made a difficult time a little easier for someone.” The pet funeral service industry is still relatively nascent in Malaysia, but it’s steadily gaining recognition. Piepie has not only educated the public about its services but has also sparked conversations about how we honour our furry kids in their final moments. “People used to think there were no options beyond burying their pets in the backyard. Now, they know they can give their pets the dignity they deserve,” she said. Social media, TV programmes, and collaborations with key opinion leaders (KOLs) have played a significant role in raising awareness. Kelly’s journey with Piepie Pet Memorial is a testament to the importance of empathy, respect, and innovation. What started as a response to personal grief has blossomed into a meaningful business that fills an emotional void for countless pet owners. As Piepie continues to grow, Kelly’s mission remains unchanged: to advocate for respect, dignity, and grace for all furry kids on their final journey.

In fact, her family ran vegetarian restaurants, giving her firsthand insights into the industry around vegetarian F&B. Perhaps this background is why she’s known as a picky eater, always wanting her food to be tasty and satisfying wherever she goes. Yet, this can be a big challenge. “As a lifelong vegetarian, I’ve always found it tough to get good plant-based food, especially in rural areas or overseas,” she explained to Vulcan Post. With a background in food science, Jessica decided to solve this problem through her very own business—Vegecore. Vegecore\\xa0launched fairly recently, but the idea behind it had been cooking for a while. The motivation behind the business is straightforward—to make plant-based eating more accessible, flavourful, and fun. The accessibility factor all comes down to convenience. With many people’s lives being so fast-paced today, Jessica felt like it was critical to make something that could actually be incorporated into Malaysians’ daily routines. That’s why Vegecore’s products can actually be eaten straight from the bag. The founder herself shared, “I often crave a comforting meal but don’t have the time or motivation to cook.” And she’s definitely not the only person with this pain point. That’s why there are quite a number of convenient and instant offerings in the market. But when it comes to plant-based foods, the options begin to dwindle a little. There are certainly brands offering it, such as Pinxin Vegan Cuisine or Mushroomlah, but it’s a relatively nascent market still. To stand out, Vegecore aims to be “flavourful and fun,” which will help break the stereotype that plant-based food is bland or “just for grandmas.” Oftentimes, people may think vegetarian meals are only for older, religious people or specific cultural groups. And while it’s true that vegetarian food is more popular with some groups, that doesn’t mean the food is only meant for those groups to enjoy. “Vegecore\\xa0isn’t here to convert anyone; it’s just a delicious, convenient choice that’s perfect for those wanting to try something new, reduce meat intake (even if it’s just once a week), or have an easy meal on hand,” the founder said. With that, the founder emphasised that Vegecore\\xa0really is for everyone—flexitarians, meat eaters, environmentalists, busy people, outdoor adventurers, or just anyone looking for a simple way to explore plant-based options. As mentioned, though, there are more vegetarian or vegan offerings in the market nowadays, thanks to changing habits and more focus on plant-based lifestyles. Yet, as Jessica said, many of these plant-based options focus on Western foods such as nuggets, burgers, and sausages. To that, Jessica wondered, “Where are the flavours that represent home, like rendang and sambal?” “When I was studying abroad, I missed home-cooked meals so much, and without a kitchen or proper cooking facilities, it was tough to find anything close to those comforting tastes,” she said. “That feeling of missing the taste of home and wishing for an easy solution is what drove me to create these recipes.” From there, Jessica began working with her team to experiment with different formulations. Although the team had fun with their experimentations, they also wanted to make sure the flavours felt authentic, resonating with both local and international palates. “It took a lot of rounds of testing to get the balance just right,” she said. Focusing on Malaysian flavours that the team felt were missing in the plant-based market, Vegecore began working with a manufacturing facility to produce its products. Jessica ensured that the facility upholds high standards and holds certifications in food manufacturing, like FSSC 22000, ISO 22000, HACCP, HALAL, and more. “They’re also committed to environmental initiatives, including solar panels and efficient waste management, something that was very important to us when choosing a production partner,” she elaborated. The halal certification also ensures that Vegecore can be enjoyed by everyone. Beyond individuals, Jessica also aims to address businesses with Vegecore. “Growing up in a family that ran vegetarian restaurants, I saw firsthand the challenges they faced, like how hard it was to keep food quality consistent with different chefs,” she explained. As such, Vegecore\\xa0aims to be a solution for restaurants and cafes, especially non-vegetarian eateries that want to include plant-based options without the hassle of extra prep. It’s chef-free, so they can offer quality plant-based dishes without needing specialised skills. “We like to think of\\xa0Vegecore\\xa0as a solution for both customers and eateries that want convenience without sacrificing flavour,” Jessica concluded. Priced from RM12.90 to RM14.90, Vegecore\\xa0products are currently available on their website, Shopee Malaysia, and Shopee Singapore. Given the “surprisingly positive” response so far, Jessica is actively working on expanding their availability. According to the founder, several customers have noted that the taste is so good they often couldn’t tell the difference between\\xa0Vegecore\\xa0and traditional meat dishes. Some also shared that Vegecore\\xa0lets them enjoy traditional flavours in a plant-based form, which they appreciate for health reasons, such as having difficulty digesting meat. Beyond expanding availability, Jessica aims to build a community around plant-based eating, which will up the startup’s market reach while increasing brand awareness. It also goes towards their long-term aim of educating people on how even one plant-based meal can make a positive environmental impact. “Ultimately, I hope to see\\xa0Vegecore\\xa0in restaurants, cafes, and convenience stores everywhere, becoming as synonymous with plant-based options as other established brands are in their categories, like how we think of Niko Neko when we see matcha,” Jessica said. “Ideally,\\xa0Vegecore’s logo will stand for high-quality, flavourful plant-based options wherever it’s seen.” She also aims to explore the export market to make\\xa0Vegecore\\xa0accessible globally. As mentioned, the business is already shipping to Singapore, marking the first step of their global ambitions. Being a vegetarian brand comes with its own set of challenges, though, since plant-based foods often aren’t the first choice for the general public. Yet, given the market response for Vegecore, Jessica feels genuinely optimistic. “People today are much more open-minded; they’re environmentally conscious, mindful of their meat intake, and curious to explore new options,” she said. “I believe that by making plant-based eating accessible, approachable, and high-quality, we can connect with a wider audience.” Although the business started as a way to solve Jessica’s own problem, in doing so, she’s now enabling others to easy, enjoyable plant-based meals too.

The report showcases Singapore’s rising prominence as a hub for ultra-high-net-worth individuals, with 58 billionaires now calling the city-state home—four more than in 2022. With a combined net worth of US$108 billion (S$145.53 billion), Singapore’s billionaire club continues to grow despite global economic challenges. This mirrors a broader trend, as the global billionaire population expanded by 4% in the past year, reversing a decline in 2022. Globally, billionaire wealth surged by 9%, reaching a staggering US$12.1 trillion (S$16.17 trillion), highlighting how the ultra-wealthy have not only weathered economic storms but thrived in them. On a global level, Singapore ranks 13th among countries with the highest billionaire populations. This is a testament to its robust infrastructure, business-friendly policies, and appeal to entrepreneurs worldwide. Globally, the United States leads the pack with 1,050 billionaires, followed by China (304) and Germany (170). In Asia, Singapore trails behind cities like Hong Kong, Beijing, and Shenzhen, which continue to dominate the billionaire rankings.

While Singapore’s billionaire population is rising, other parts of Asia are seeing a decline. The overall billionaire population in Asia fell by 3.5% last year, driven by notable drops in China (-14%) and Hong Kong (for the third consecutive year). In contrast, India experienced a 16% increase in billionaires, the largest growth in Asia. On the other hand, North America and Europe saw dramatic increases in high-net-worth individuals, with billionaire populations growing by 33.4% and 29.5%, respectively. Here are some other interesting insights: These billionaires account for 16% of global billionaire wealth, a sharp rise from 4% a decade ago. Their total net worth is now US$2 trillion (S$2.7 trillion). As Singapore continues to attract billionaires and wealthy entrepreneurs alike, it’s clear that its strategic policies and vibrant economy are paying off. It’s not just growing wealth; it’s shaping the future of business in Asia and beyond. With billionaires holding a quarter of the global ultra-high-net-worth population’s total wealth, Singapore’s rise is a reflection of how the city remains a magnet for global movers and shakers.

Cue Mariah Carey’s “It’s Time” whistle notes. But for most people, your festive energy is likely picking up now as we inch closer to the magical month of December. While Christmas Day itself is typically when the gift exchanges happen, why not partake in tiny little gifts all throughout the lead-up to D-Day. If you’ve never heard of advent calendars before, they’re those boxes with little tabs, usually dated “1” to “24”, referring to the first 24 days of December leading up to Christmas. Each of these tabs can be opened to reveal little (or sometimes normal-sized) gifts. In case you didn’t know, here’s a little history lesson. The concept comes from the German word\\xa0Adventskalender, which was used to count the days of\\xa0Advent\\xa0in anticipation of\\xa0Christmas.\\xa0At least, Wikipedia says so. And, yeah, maybe the modern-day version of it is a little consumeristic, but, hey, it’s cute. Here are four Malaysian brands who are tapping into advent calendars this Christmas, and where you can shop for them.

Called Stationery Wonderland, the advent calendar features whimsical designs created by local artist Nelson Lip.

Excitingly, CzipLee\\xa0has additionally included limited edition holiday-exclusive items by\\xa0Lametna and pim.kl. Apparently, no two calendars are alike. While the items remain consistent, each calendar features unique variations in design and colour. But here’s the kicker—they only made 100 of these limited-edition boxes. So, if you’re a stationery lover (or have one in your life), be sure to get these while stocks last. The retail value of this box is RM750.

The land of the rising sun is highly advanced in technology, specifically in electronics, robotics, and automotive manufacturing. Yet, while you may know Tokyo for its large firms like Hitachi and SONY, its startup scene is undergoing a dynamic transformation. Thanks to government incentives like those from the Tokyo Metropolitan Government (TMG), it’s now emerging as an international startup hub. TMG has set a goal to increase its number of startups, unicorns, and collaborative projects between governments and businesses by tenfold within five years, supported by platforms like the Tokyo Innovation Base (TIB) and events like SusHi Tech Tokyo 2025. And they want foreign startups to be a significant part of this growth. Here are five reasons why startups from Malaysia and Singapore should expand to Tokyo. From a geographical standpoint, Tokyo is a well-positioned business hub in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region. China is Japan‘s largest trading partner, while Japan also has good ties with countries like South Korea, New Zealand, Australia, and ASEAN states. Tokyo’s close proximity to these markets streamlines entry and expansion, cutting down the time and expenses typically involved in international travel. Japan also has a network of free trade agreements (FTAs) with multiple countries such as the ones named above. Fun fact: FTAs usually simplify customs procedures and make it easier for business people to travel or live in each other’s country. As such, Malaysian and Singaporean startups will gain direct access to major economies that open more doors to new customer segments. One example is Malaysia’s Entomal, a biotechnology firm using black soldier flies (BSF) to treat food waste. While touring around Tokyo’s innovation hubs with Selangor Information Technology and Digital Economy Corporation (Sidec), the startup managed to discuss partnerships with local Japanese and international corporations. Backed by TMG, the Tokyo Innovation Base (TIB) was established to foster collaboration and networking, especially for early-stage startups. Designed for hosting regular events and conferences, TIB offers key industry players the space to connect. Whether you’re an entrepreneur, investor, or innovator, the business hub is a gateway to exchange ideas and gain insights into Japan’s market. Besides that, TIB also provides a range of services for new startups, or entrepreneurs new to Japan, such as: With its open and supportive culture, TIB makes it easier for foreign startups to navigate Tokyo’s business landscape. Invest Tokyo, TMG’s other programme, is also available to make the process smoother and less risky for foreign startups. To create a cycle of innovation and economic growth, Invest Tokyo offers a variety of initiatives for startups considering business expansion in Tokyo. This includes consulting services, tailored guidance on fundraising, legal frameworks, and business-matching services. The programme even simplifies the process of setting up a business in Japan by providing subsidies, visa support, and residency programmes to foreign startups. Together, these help foreign startups gain deeper insights into Japan’s market and give them a better chance of succeeding. So it’s highly encouraged that Malaysian and Singaporeans startups take advantage of Invest Tokyo’s resources. If you haven’t heard, SusHi Tech Tokyo 2025 is returning in just a few months. Launched as a way to address urban and environmental challenges through technological innovation, it’s known as one of Asia’s largest startup conferences. The event is happening from May 8 to May 10, 2025, offering international startups a chance to connect with investors and showcase innovations. Another highlight of the event is SusHi Tech Challenge, a pitch contest for both local and foreign startups where you can win a cash prize. Last year, SusHi Tech Tokyo 2024 had over 434 startup booths (of which 60% were from outside Japan), over 200 cooperating companies, and over 3,485 business negotiations. The event attracted a total of 40,206 participants from across the globe. This makes it an ideal platform for Malaysian and Singaporean businesses to gain exposure and secure investments. Startups can now apply to exhibit and participate in SusHi Tech Challenge, or simply attend to network and explore other opportunities. Tickets are currently on sale, so be sure to reserve your spot. Japan’s known for many things, but perhaps the lesser talked-about aspects are its skilled workforce and innovation resources. Tokyo is home to world-renowned universities and research institutions, serving as hubs that nurture university-based startups. Within Tokyo, distinctive areas such as Marunouchi, Toranomon, Nihonbashi, Shibuya, and Hongo each make up their own ecosystem. By expanding to Tokyo, startups would benefit from TIB’s help in connecting with these institutes. Having access to Japan’s skilled talent pool would accelerate the R&D efforts of Malaysian and Singaporean startups. Malaysian startup Entomal is one such example, as its co-founder told us that they found a Japanese university sharing Entomal’s vision for sustainable waste solutions, and the firm is hoping to partner with them soon. \\u200b\\u200bWith Tokyo ranking first in the world in gross domestic product (GDP) and first in the world in regional population, it’s an exemplary location for foreign startups to take their business further. Its strategic location, strong government support, startup-focused platforms, and skilled workforce, are just a few of the elements that would help Malaysian and Singaporean startups succeed abroad. Additionally, the networking opportunities available through platforms like TIB and SusHi Tech Tokyo 2025 are designed to propel startups forward. All in all, Tokyo is ready to welcome the next generation of global startups, so don’t pass up the opportunity to grow your company in one of the most vibrant cities globally.

Apparently, the term is used quite generously here, with even UHT (Ultra Heat Treatment) milks sporting the label. But there’s a very clear difference. As a smart consumer, the easiest way to tell truly fresh milk apart is by checking its shelf life, ingredients, and preservatives used. Truly fresh, minimally processed fresh milk typically would last no longer than three days after opening—if unopened and refrigerated, just over a week. With confusing labels galore, it’s no wonder that The Farm Shop wants to set the record straight when it comes to what fresh milk actually means. Four women—Sushma Sivasriamphai, Karen Kow, Hasniza Binti Ali, and Dr Tan I-Lene—brought The Farm Shop to life in 2022 with the goal of making minimally processed food more accessible. With a tagline of “Real Food, Real Good”, the brand aims to keep their offerings as true as possible. As dairy plays a starring role in the majority of their product line-up, they had to scrutinise the nutrition of the dairy cows themselves, and work with local farmers to improve and curate their cows’ feed. That’s where Dr Tan, a professional veterinarian with a background in agriculture extension services, brings in her expertise. “As a veterinarian, if we want to prevent disease from happening and we want to prevent the cow from falling sick, we have to first look at nutrition.” “[Dairy cows] need a lot of energy and protein,” she explained, likening them to professional athletes. “Our athlete’s diet is precisely formulated with optimum amounts of fibre, energy, vitamins, and minerals.” This leads to better performance and a more nutritious product for consumers. As passionate changemakers, though, The Farm Shop doesn’t stop at just solving that farming pain point. The team also provides their partner farmers with constructive feedback to improve farming practices, back-to-back credit, and financial support, among other things. In another effort to uplift local agriculture, the brand buys the milk at a fair price that tallies with the product’s value. It’s one of the reasons why they’re priced slightly higher than other options in the market, where 1 litre of their milk starts from RM10. “For us, a low price strategy is actually a race to the bottom,” Dr Tan explained. “There will always be somebody who will come in with more resources, more money, to give you a lower price. But the question is, at what cost?” “Producing a litre of milk costs a certain amount of money. [To bring down the cost,] manufacturers will start adding things that are not milk. Things like water, a very cheap resource.” It goes without saying that this lowers the overall nutritional value of the milk, and we might end up spending more on additional supplements or medical visits instead. If there’s one thing that the brand guarantees, it’s that their products are not over-processed and do not contain preservatives or shelf-life enhancers. That’s why their fresh milk has a 10-day shelf life, and is best consumed within three days after opening. To add, all of The Farm Shop’s products travel from farm to shelves within three days, once more in a bid to maintain that freshness. Even so, due to breaks in refrigeration, some products may inevitably turn bad on the shelf. But that’s far from a con to the team. “Real food spoils and it’s a good thing,” Dr Tan said. “It means that we are really standing by our products to give you only the real stuff and not messing up natural processes.” To combat customer inconvenience,The Farm Shop offers a resolution if customers report a bad product to them within 24 hours of purchase. “That is the level of commitment we have to our loyal supporters who are really looking for the best nutrition.” The Farm Shop’s catalogue currently boasts a good selection of fresh dairy products, such as whole milk, barista’s choice milk, the crowd-favourite chocolate milk, goat’s milk, and A2 milk. Fun fact: A2 milk has A2 protein, which was traditionally the predominant protein in milk and is more easily digested by humans. However, commercial farming has led to cows producing A1 protein instead, which can trigger inflammation and bloating when consumed. These can be found in major grocery stores including Village Grocer, BIG, The Food Merchant, AEON, Giant, Mercato, Lotus’s, NSK Grocer, MMZZ Grocer, and more. To make it easier for consumers, the brand provides home delivery services too, just like a modern-day milk(wo)man bringing your dairy needs straight to your doorstep. Customers in Klang Valley simply need to pre-order two days ahead on their website. If you live in other parts of Malaysia, like Ipoh, Seremban, Melaka, Penang, or Johor Bahru, deliveries happen every other week. Families big on milk could opt for their monthly subscription plan called the Milk (WO)Man Plan. The package offers what the brand claims to be the lowest price in town, with each litre of fresh milk going for as low as RM9.50/bottle, and it’ll be delivered on a weekly basis at no delivery charge. Even without going into the nitty-gritty of The Farm Shop’s inner workings, it’s clear to see that they take their job of bringing fresh, minimally processed products to the market very seriously. That’s why they prioritise a close relationship with consumers, to better understand their needs and find ways to address them. Having successfully raised RM2.1 million in pre-seed funding, the co-founders believe that they’re on track to making waves in the nutrition consumption of Malaysian households, starting with changing our fresh milk game for good.

We’ve seen exciting ideas brought to life like BoomGrow’s 5G-connected vertical farm and Brikoole (“breathable bricks” to reduce air conditioning) that won the national James Dyson Award 2024. Of course, achieving these feats comes with its own set of challenges, such as funding gaps and the resources for research and development (R&D). But Malaysian startups and entrepreneurs don’t have to face these challenges alone. The government has various programmes available to help you grow and turn your bold ideas into innovative tech solutions, like the Supercharger Series. It’s a free programme under the Malaysian Research Accelerator for Technology and Innovation (MRANTI) with the objective of fast-tracking the commercialisation of startup R&D projects. In simpler terms, this programme helps turn your research and ideas into market-ready solutions, faster and more effectively. This is done by connecting your startups with key industry professionals like innovators and researchers, and allowing you to explore more funding opportunities. But what benefits do Malaysian startups gain from joining the Supercharger Series? In today’s fast-paced tech world, staying ahead means more than just keeping up; you have to constantly be innovating. By aligning with Malaysia’s strategic priorities (as outlined in the Malaysian Grand Challenge) startups will be at the forefront of industries set to define the next generation of innovation. This includes fields like agriculture, healthcare, food security, and smart technology. The Supercharger Series focuses on these industries too, so startups will be more technologically adept at creating solutions for current and future problems. For example, as part of the Supercharger Series’ efforts, MRANTI partners with Universiti Malaysia Sabah (UMS) to provide startups with up-to-date knowledge and expertise on food security and drone technology. Such collaborations equip startups to develop cutting-edge solutions and position themselves as industry leaders. The Supercharger Series acts as a bridge between academic research and the commercial world, connecting you with Malaysia’s top experts in R&D and innovation. This support helps you fine-tune your strategies and fast-track your tech development. Whether it’s improving a prototype, overcoming regulatory challenges, or planning your market launch, the program provides the guidance you need to move forward with confidence. Mohd Izzat Muslim, founder of Fulkrum Interactive Media, shared, “The Supercharger Series stands out for being much more hands-on and practical.” Izzat used to struggle with market penetration and effectively utilising funds from grants until he learnt new strategies from the programme. Under the Supercharger Series, MRANTI offers a more in-depth bootcamp called the Supercharger R2C (Road-to-Commercialisation) Bootcamp. Designed for startups in the pre-commercialisation stage, this bootcamp starts with a three-day workshop and continues with a three-month facilitation programme. This hands-on guidance will equip your startup with the know-how to bring your products and services to market. Key commercialisation topics you’ll learn here include defining your value proposition, validating your target market, addressing intellectual property and regulatory considerations, and developing a launch strategy for your innovation. Startups that have benefitted from this are bootcamp alumni like Qmed Asia (a healthcare tech startup), Agiliux (an insurance tech startup), and Life Origin (a foodtech startup). To join, you can keep an eye out for announcements on the next Supercharger R2C Bootcamp here. At the moment, MRANTI’s Supercharger Series is held in key innovation hubs such as Kuala Lumpur, Penang, Johor, Sabah, and Sarawak. But they’re committed to expanding the programme’s reach in more locations based on the needs of the startup community. “Our goal is to create equal opportunities for startups across Malaysia, supporting local ecosystems and facilitating greater nationwide impact,” MRANTI’s team told us. This year’s Supercharger Finale will be held at the I-Nation Global Summit 2024 on December 3, where participants will get a chance to learn commercialisation strategies from Dr. Hamed Motaghi from Quebec University, Canada. The session is scheduled for 4PM to 5PM at Connexion Convention Centre, Bangsar. Admission is free, but you should secure your seats now before tickets run out.

Some people aim to eat healthier and work out more, but for me, it’s about managing my finances better. One way I’ve been attempting to achieve this is by tracking my spending. The only problem? Manually logging in the data gets too tedious, and I end up giving up. I’ve tried apps, sheets, and even jotting it down in physical notebooks—nothing works. But I recently came across NajibAI, which could be a game changer for struggling folks like me. Created by Malaysian founder Dylan Tan, NajibAI is a chat-based WhatsApp artificial intelligence (AI) to record your receipts and track your spending. It’s one of the few free tools that Dylan’s company, Replyr.ai (a firm that helps turn WhatsApp chats into paying customers using AI), makes. “As a fun side project, I created NajibAI, a free WhatsApp tool that helps Malaysians manage their expenses,” Dylan shared with us. “It’s a tool for Malaysians, by a Malaysian, to make tracking spending easy, practical, and a bit more fun.” Anyone can try it as long as you have a WhatsApp account. All you have to do is snap a picture of your receipt, send it to your chat with NajibAI, and he’ll enthusiastically help store your records for you. Currently, NajibAI only tracks a few key elements in the receipt: Upon receiving the photo, NajibAI will extract these details from the receipt and share them with you for double-checking. This will then be stored in NajibAI’s memory bank once you’ve confirmed the details. You can also add notes to the receipt’s record for your future reference. Based on the key elements, you can request a rundown of your spending habits, which is what I personally find the most useful. For example, if you want to find out how much you’ve already spent on food this month, you can just ask NajibAI. Another nifty thing about this WhatsApp-based AI tool is that it works for receipts in any language and any currency. This makes it convenient for when you’re travelling abroad and want to stick with a set vacation budget. I was initially sceptical about this claim, but I’ve tried it with a few foreign receipts online in languages like Mandarin, Russian, and even Greek. NajibAI was able to extract all the key information without a hitch, for the most part, but it doesn’t necessarily localise the business’s name or currency used in the receipt. As the tracker is still in Beta testing, it’s not always perfect. Some occasional hiccups I’ve noticed are problems in extracting the business name (especially if it’s in a non-Latin language) and getting the total amount spent confused. The response time of the chat-based tool is also slightly slower than what I’m used to, typically averaging five to 10 seconds before replying. However, these are just minor issues that can be improved with tweaks. A bigger, more pressing concern would actually be about data and privacy since it’s a WhatsApp-based tool. To this, Dylan reassured that interacting with NajibAI is no different from messaging any other business on WhatsApp. “Everything happens within WhatsApp’s secure environment. We don’t link receipt data back to personal identities, and the system operates within WhatsApp’s privacy guidelines.” That said, he’s actively working on adding more transparency features to give users better visibility and control over their data. Just today, he rolled out a new feature allowing users to request their data to be deleted by simply asking NajibAI. “I don’t foresee significant legal issues since NajibAI operates within WhatsApp’s terms of service. However, I’m keeping a close watch on feedback and I am ready to adapt if users or other stakeholders raise concerns. The goal is to maintain trust and operate responsibly while keeping this helpful tool free for users,” Dylan stated. As for why he chose WhatsApp, it comes down to user convenience. It’s no secret that WhatsApp is a platform that many Malaysians use on a daily basis, so Dylan figured it would make the most practical sense. He believes managing expenses can feel more natural when done in a space that people already associate with communication and sharing images. That said, NajibAI is a glimpse into what’s possible with AI and plays a role in what Replyr.ai is building. Its main business focuses on automating sales on WhatsApp for businesses, using AI agents to perform actions like collecting payments, updating CRMs, and scheduling appointments. Now let’s address the elephant in the room… Why the name Najib? “I chose the name as a playful nod to Malaysian pop culture. Bossku has become part of our everyday slang, and I wanted NajibAI to feel approachable and local,” Dylan explained. “It’s just a fun, relatable way to make expense tracking more interesting.” While you may think it’s referring to a certain someone, the founder reaffirmed that there’s no explicit reference to anyone. As for legal concerns, he’s done his due diligence to ensure there’s no defamatory content or explicit association. “It’s really just [about] creating a light-hearted interaction [more] than anything else. Managing expenses is boring, but NajibAI adds a bit of Malaysian humour into the mix,” he said. This is actually one of the key lessons he learnt with his previous creation called AhBengGPT, a chat-based game powered by ChatGPT, where players try to negotiate for an iPhone from a Malaysian Ah Beng phone seller. “AhBengGPT taught me the importance of keeping interactions fun, engaging, and uniquely local. Malaysians appreciate humour and relatable touches, which is why NajibAI leans into the ‘Bossku’ term, just like how AhBengGPT would speak with really strong Malaysian slang,” he shared. To help more Malaysians manage their expenses better, Dylan intends to keep NajibAI free for everyone to use. It comes at a small cost for Replyr.ai, but he’s more interested in providing its larger benefit to more people. For now, he’s focused on learning how users interact with the AI and refining the user experience from there.

Not only that, but Volvo Malaysia Sdn Bhd’s (Volvo Trucks) latest range of heavy-duty trucks are also designed to revolutionise Malaysia’s logistics industry by boosting fuel efficiency and reducing carbon emissions. With a focus on safety and sustainability, the new models align with the country’s growing need for greener and safer transportation solutions. “Safety is at the heart of what we do,” Volvo Trucks Southeast Asia and Japan Managing Director Anna Engblom said in a press release. “These new trucks are engineered to protect both drivers and road users while addressing environmental challenges.” Like modern cars today, these trucks are equipped with forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking and adaptive cruise control lane-keeping support. These features aim to reduce the risks associated with heavy vehicles on Malaysia’s roads. Its new Volvo Dynamic Steering (VDS) system ensures stability under varying conditions, while an optional Camera Monitoring System (CMS) offers enhanced vision, reducing blind spots and improving night-time visibility.

The newly designed cabins feature: These upgrades aim to provide drivers with a productive and comfortable environment, contributing to safer and more efficient operations. Volvo Trucks is also investing in driver training to ensure operators can maximise the benefits of the new trucks. Additionally, its Iron Women Programme, launched in 2024, aims to upskill and empower women to become heavy-duty truck drivers. Five women have already graduated, with plans to train 100 women by the end of 2025. Volvo Trucks continues to set benchmarks in safety, recently earning a five-star rating from Euro NCAP for its Volvo FH and FM models. This recognition underscores its position as a leader in innovative and reliable heavy-duty truck solutions. Trucks don’t usually get the spotlight when we think about innovation or sustainability. But Volvo’s latest heavy-duty trucks might have just represented a technological leap and also a commitment to a better, greener tomorrow for Malaysia’s transport industry.

It wasn’t something that resonated with modern lifestyles.” Yet, her early interest in health remained a quiet hum in the background. Life had other plans, with Paris pursuing a career far removed from wellness. That is, until 2016, when a serendipitous discovery of Synergy Via Online (SVO)—a brand committed to simplifying health—rekindled her passion. She dove into self-learning, devouring books, attending courses, and immersing herself in the industry. “Through SVO, I realised health management could be accessible and effortless,” Paris said. The brand’s philosophy aligned perfectly with her belief that wellness shouldn’t be a burden. “I went from being an observer to an active participant. That moment marked a turning point for me,” she told Vulcan Post. It was this combination of self-taught skills and formal education that laid the foundation for Paris Queen, her health supplement brand. When Paris launched Paris Queen, she had one goal: to create a brand people could trust. “I noticed two major gaps in the health supplement market—quality and transparency,” she said. “Many products either failed to meet safety standards or didn’t disclose their ingredients clearly. It struck me how much trust was lacking in this space.” Determined to change that, Paris prioritised rigorous quality control and transparent communication. Every product carried by Paris Queen undergoes stringent testing to ensure both safety and effectiveness, and the brand shares the certifications of each product on their website. “If I wouldn’t use or recommend it myself, it doesn’t make it into our product line,” she said firmly. “We want to be synonymous with effectiveness and safety, and that’s been our guiding principle from day one.” Paris Queen has also chosen a direct-to-consumer model to ensure its customers receive the best possible experience. “Currently, our products are exclusively available online through our official website. We don’t work with any retailers at this time,” she shared. According to their website, there are 11 brands under them such as ZENSO, BIO-SERIES, Femoire and KidAone, with their primary product line coming from Wellous, a brand with nearly a decade of experience and accolades in the wellness industry. This strategic decision allows Paris Queen to maintain control over product quality and freshness while fostering a closer relationship with its customers. “By selling directly through our site, we can also offer personalised customer service and ensure that everyone who purchases from Paris Queen has a seamless and trusted experience,” she added. Launching a health supplement brand in a crowded market wasn’t easy. Paris faced stiff competition, evolving consumer demands, and logistical challenges during the pandemic. Yet, she saw these obstacles as opportunities to grow. “What kept me going was remembering why I started,” Paris reflected. “I wanted to help people manage their health effortlessly with products they could trust.” She credited her determination, along with support from SVO, for navigating these hurdles. “SVO gave me invaluable opportunities, like attending a nutritionist course in Taiwan earlier this year. It helped me provide better advice to customers and refine our product offerings.” This focus on customer-centric solutions has paid off.

Founded in 2021, BoomGrow provides hyper-local farming solutions designed to create healthier, more sustainable food systems. Through its patent-pending technology, the startup optimises conditions for plant growth, driving indoor vertical farming to new levels of precision and efficiency with reduced environmental impact. You might be wondering, what do indoor faming systems have to do with a mobile network operator? Well, a lot actually. At least, there should be, because the technology can really enhance sustainable farming practices and food production. By integrating 5G connectivity, AI, and XR (extended reality) with precision farming technology, BoomGrow and CelcomDigi aim to transform the agricultural industry in Malaysia. Specifically, the three main areas of innovation that this partnership focuses on are as follows: Now powered by CelcomDigi’s 5G connectivity, BoomGrow Machine Farms can connect to a range of integrated sensors and monitoring systems that are able to give real-time data feedback. This allows for more precise control of indoor farming environments and optimal conditions for crop growth. Since the multiple Machine Farms feed back complex datasets and plant visualisation, advanced AI-powered analytics is especially helpful as it enables deeper analyses. For instance, if there is an alert raised in one of the farms, the team will gain insights through the analytics to derive the root cause of the issue and address it immediately. This will enhance decision-making processes and improve overall productivity. Furthermore, data collected from all the Machine Farms across the country are consolidated into a centralised dashboard, allowing for seamless oversight and management. Through XR technology powered by local startup XR Associate, future agronomists can engage in immersive training programmes remotely. This allows them to gain hands-on experience and expertise in managing modern farming systems from different locations where BoomGrow Machine Farms are present. It will also help facilitate BoomGrow in onboarding new agronomists as they scale to roll out more Machine Farms in future. BoomGrow is amongst the 40 pioneering partners of CelcomDigi’s AI Experience Centre (AiX), a facility to stimulate rapid innovation of 5G, AI, and other emerging technology solutions across diverse industries to accelerate Malaysia’s 5G-AI aspirations. CelcomDigi’s Chief Innovation Officer, T. Kugan said, “We are pleased to have BoomGrow as our partner to reimagine farming in the age of digital-everything.” The partnership was officiated by the Minister of Digital YB Gobind Singh Deo at Gurney Paragon Mall in Penang, where one of BoomGrow’s Machine Farms has been deployed. To date, there are multiple BoomGrow Machine Farms established across Malaysia and the Philippines with one located at CelcomDigi AiX in Subang Jaya, Selangor. Farming and agriculture at large has been a pillar in Malaysia’s economy, contributing around 7.1% to our country’s GDP in 2021. Yet, much of the industry has been largely left unchanged over decades, which is worrying especially when put in the context of rising food insecurity and climate changes. That’s why innovative startups like BoomGrow and collaborations with tech giants like CelcomDigi are important to spur on growth and improved solutions. As BoomGrow’s CEO and Co-Founder, Murali Krishnamurthy, said, “The integration of 5G technology into our operations allows us to unlock new levels of efficiency and sustainability, driving the future of agriculture.” He added, “CelcomDigi’s strong support for tech startups like ours not only advances our capabilities but also contributes to the growth of Malaysia’s startup ecosystem. Together, we are shaping a more innovative and sustainable future for the industry.” Also Read\\n15 yrs of witnessing telco inefficiencies drove this duo to bootstrap RM100K to modernise it Featured Image Credit: (from left to right) YB Joshua Woo, ADUN Pulau Tikus; T.

These changes cut crop yields, affecting B40 farmers who rely on their harvests for income. At the same time, Malaysia’s rapid urbanisation is leading to a decrease in arable land. These issues threaten food security, farmer livelihoods, and sustainable farming in urbanising regions. The agritech industry must find alternative ways to address these issues. That’s exactly what partners Grayscale Technologies (Grayscale) and Universiti Teknologi MARA Penang Cawangan Pulau Pinang (UiTM) aim to do with their Urban Farming Cabin. Meet the team: A subsidiary of TechnoDex Berhad, Grayscale provides technology solutions such as IoT, app development, cybersecurity, and more across various industries. UiTM is a local public university focusing on subjects such as business and management, social sciences and humanities, as well as science and technology fields with 34 campuses around Malaysia. Put simply, the Urban Farming Cabin is a high-tech, closed-environment unit designed to bring farming to urban locations. Currently in its proof of concept stage, here’s how the cabin works: A large shipping container is converted into a smart greenhouse. Inside this container, plants are grown without soil through a hydroponics system. Internet of Things (IoT) sensors control the weather inside the cabin. These sensors track temperature, humidity, light, and nutrients in real time to optimise crop cultivation. “For example, if the temperature inside the cabin gets too high or too low, the system can automatically adjust fans or heaters to maintain the ideal conditions for plant growth,” explained Mohamed Syazwan Bin Osman, the Project Lead of the Urban Farming Cabin and Senior Lecturer at UiTM. The cabin’s closed environment protects crops from pests and diseases, ensuring consistent and high yields. While it can be likened to a greenhouse, Syazwan clarified that this cabin is slightly different. “Traditional greenhouses have their merits but often require large plots of land, which are not always available in urban areas. Furthermore, they rely heavily on manual monitoring and control, which can be labour-intensive and less precise,” he stated. These greenhouses also use soil and need extensive land and water. The Urban Farming Cabin, however, uses hydroponics, which can grow plants without soil and use significantly less water by up to 90% compared to conventional farming. With IoT integration, they can have precise and automated control of the farming environment. This not only reduces labour but also boosts productivity and crop yields. The Urban Farming Cabin is designed to be scalable as well. “Our cabins are modular, meaning they can be set up anywhere, even in places without farmland, like city rooftops, parking lots, or unused spaces,” elaborated Tunku Izzudin Shah, Director of Grayscale and CMO of TechnoDex Group. “They can be stacked or arranged to fit diﬀerent areas, making it possible to farm in urban areas.” This flexibility helps produce fresh, local food and reduces the need to transport food over long distances, cutting down on carbon emissions while bringing fresh produce to more communities. B40 farmers are the primary beneficiaries of this system. Should the Urban Farming Cabin pan out as intended, it promises to upskill farmers through UiTM’s expertise, and eventually provide a reliable and sustainable source of income. “By producing high-value crops such as salad greens, which have seen a significant price increase in recent years, these farmers can achieve better economic stability and move towards higher income brackets,” Tunku Izzudin Shah added. The system’s efficiency and low resource requirements make it particularly suitable for urban farmers who face constraints on their agritech skills gap. Ultimately, Grayscale and UiTM’s main objective for farmers is to educate them on new agritech methods that can produce high-value crops based on market demand. This empowers B40 farmers with the skillsets and potential for higher earning power to sustain their livelihoods. To ensure that the Urban Farming Cabin remains economical for B40 farmers to adopt, Grayscale and UiTM have several plans to make it financially viable. For one, a CODO (Company Owned, Dealer Operate) model can be applied. It’s where the cabins are owned by a central entity, like a cooperative or agricultural company, and operated by local farmers. This model shares investment costs, reducing the financial burden on individual farmers. Farmers can also lease the cabins or join profit-sharing arrangements, benefiting without large upfront investments. Securing subsidies and grants for B40 farmers is another strategy. Syazwan elaborated that programmes like the Rancangan Malaysia Kedua Belas (RMKe-12), which promotes smart agriculture, can provide financial support. For distribution, the team plans to establish supply agreements with restaurants, supermarkets, and food processors for fresh, locally-grown produce. This approach ensures farmers have a reliable income stream. The Urban Farming Cabin goes beyond simply placing a farm in a container. Grayscale and UiTM aim for this project to set a benchmark in sustainable urban agriculture that’s scalable and replicable worldwide. “By demonstrating the viability and benefits of integrating advanced technologies in urban farming, we aim to inspire other communities and institutions to adopt similar practices. This can lead to a more resilient and sustainable global food system, capable of withstanding the challenges posed by climate change and urbanisation,” Tunku Izzudin Shah shared. Furthermore, integrating technology in the Urban Farming Cabin can greatly pique the interest of younger generations. Modern technology in agriculture makes farming more innovative and less labour-intensive, appealing to today’s youth. Tunku Izzudin believes the project’s success will demonstrate IoT technology’s crucial role in precision farming, optimising crop production with data-driven insights. “Moreover, the integration of IoT can facilitate better resource management, reduce waste, and improve overall eﬃciency,” he added. On June 7, 2024, UiTM and Grayscale signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), formalising their commitment to the research, development, and commercialisation of the Urban Farming Cabin. By combining UiTM’s and Grayscale’s strengths, both parties are poised to innovate in agritech, addressing urban agriculture challenges and delivering tangible benefits to the B40 community and beyond.

Her background is in construction. How did these two Malaysians from different fields come together to start an urban farming company together? Despite their different paths, Qi-Guang and Karen have been friends for years since college, laying the groundwork for their business partnership. The spark for that partnership came up casually during an afternoon catch up over cakes and tea, of all things. “We realised that Malaysia had a significant challenge with food security, relying heavily on the Cameron Highlands region for its vegetable supply,” Karen recalled. This dependency highlighted the need for diversification and local alternatives. That’s when the two decided they could help fill this gap. Although neither have formal backgrounds in agriculture, their passion and connection for the field run deep. Qi-Guang has been the driving force behind this endeavor, having grown up in a family dedicated to agricultural research. Karen shared, “From a young age, Qi-Guang was exposed to various farming techniques like hydroponics, aeroponics, aquaponics, organic farming, composting, bokashi, plantations, and orchards.” As for Karen herself, she grew up in Sabah with her maternal grandparents who were farmers. There, she saw firsthand the value of hard work and the rewards of farming. Combining their backgrounds, they founded Tiny\\xa0Acres\\xa0in mid-2022, officially kicking off operations in November that year. Essentially, Tiny\\xa0Acres\\xa0is an innovative indoor vertical farm that grows up to 14 varieties of microgreens. But more than just selling microgreens, Tiny Acres’ goal is to pioneer a comprehensive approach to urban farming. “Starting with microgreens gives us a foundation of sustainable, high-nutrient produce, but our vision goes much further,” Karen elaborated. For one, their work doesn’t end at just harvesting greens. Keeping in mind the demographic of people who don’t like eating vegetables, Tiny Acres has created a liquified form of their greens. They told Vulcan Post that they’re also developing a honey probiotic drink that includes microgreens, combining the health benefits of probiotics with nutrient-dense microgreens. With these healthy drinks as well as grow kits, they have been broadening their impact and reach. These efforts go towards their mission to revolutionise urban farming by bringing the farm directly to the city, significantly reducing the food miles associated with traditional agriculture. “This not only cuts down the environmental impact of transporting food over long distances but also ensures that our customers get the freshest produce possible,” they added. “By integrating the farm into the urban landscape,\\xa0Tiny\\xa0Acres\\xa0enhances food security and promotes sustainable living practices among city dwellers.” Committed to supporting the local economy, the farm also collaborates with local farmers, chefs, and businesses to foster a vibrant community network. “Through these partnerships, we supply high-quality produce and engage in educational initiatives to share knowledge about sustainable farming practices,” they elaborated. By promoting education and collaboration, they aim to build a more resilient and self-sufficient local food system. Something we noticed, though, was that Tiny Acres’ name sounded quite similar to another microgreens brand we featured in the past, Tiny Greens. When asked about it, the team shared that they are aware of the similar name, but had decided on Tiny Acres because it summed up their ambition to compress the vast expanse of traditional farmland into a more compact, efficient urban footprint. In any case, Tiny Acres isn’t the only urban farming startup in town, though. There are many other businesses in the scene such as Agroz and BoomGrow. But rather than focus on competition, they’re honing in on partnerships that contribute towards the larger ecosystem. For one, they’ve begun partnering with other startups, chefs, distributors, cafes, and various local enterprises to more seamlessly integrate their products into the local food ecosystem. With these partnerships, Tiny Acres’ microgreens can be turned into culinary creations or health-focused products. Farming, even when it is urbanised, isn’t as easy as just planting some seeds and hoping for the best, though. A major challenge the team has faced involves the R&D process of growing new varieties of microgreens. The founders explained that microgreens require specific conditions to thrive. Each type of microgreen has its own set of requirements in terms of light, water, and nutrients. Believing in the end goal, the founders have invested significant time and resources to experimenting with various growing techniques and environments. “This meticulous approach has allowed us to expand our range of offerings while maintaining the high quality our customers expect,” they said. On the topic of customers, another significant challenge is involving business-to-consumer (B2C) sales. “Many consumers are still unaware of what microgreens are and the substantial health benefits they offer,” the founders pointed out. As such, the company has been committed to educating the market, as challenging as that process may be. Education is not just something that happens overnight, after all—the team has invested money and time in initiatives like creating informative content, hosting tasting sessions, and engaging in direct marketing efforts. As of now, the\\xa0Tiny\\xa0Acres\\xa0team still only consists of Karen and Qi-Guang who manage the majority of the farming and sales operations. The duo believes their hands-on approach allows them to maintain high standards of quality and ensure that every aspect of the business aligns with their vision and values. But of course, the team would have to scale up too especially given their ambitious goals to expand their product offerings beyond microgreens. “We plan to offer a wider range of vegetables and herbs, becoming a comprehensive urban farming solution that provides our community with locally grown, pesticide-free produce,” they said. Beyond manpower and expertise, this will require major upgrades in infrastructure and technology. However, these would all be worthy investments that contribute towards not just Qi-Guang and Karen’s dreams, but also the future of Malaysia.

Contributing around 7.1% to the country’s GDP back in 2021, it’s undoubtedly a key part of our economy. However, much of the industry has been largely left unchanged over decades. In order to stay ahead of the curve, there must be more innovative solutions from startups. With that in mind, one of the panels at the recent KL20 Summit had been all about agritech. Here are three agritech startups that were highlighted, and how they’re solving the agriculture labour crunch in Malaysia. A homegrown startup, BoomGrow is rethinking farming through smart containerised farming systems. In these modular, plug-and-play systems, factors like water, light, and humidity can be adjusted to ensure the utmost consistency of output and yield. Essentially, they are removing unpredictability and uncertainty, and allowing for precision farming. “We are stripping away the uncertainty in an industry that’s only been uncertain forever, that’s what technology has enabled us to do,” elaborated BoomGrow co-founder Jay Desan. The startup is also all about being hyperlocal and putting their farms where consumers want and need them. The truth is, many of our foods need to travel hundreds if not thousands of kilometres just to get to us, resulting in lots of carbon emissions. At the same time, BoomGrow’s farming system is highly cost-optimised, thus creating a financially and environmentally sustainable solution. Based in the UK, Wootzano produces highly dexterous robots that can work like human beings in a production line. These robotic arms can pick, sort, and grade produce while looking for issues, diseases, or other specifications. The company just recently ventured into Malaysia, which is the first Southeast Asian country they’re active in. Currently, the robots are already being deployed for bird’s eye chilis, a crop that CEO Atif Syed said is in dire need of automation. “Labour is an issue everywhere,” he said. “Not just in developed nations. What was surprising to us was even in developing countries, labour has been quite hard to find. People are not willing to do the job, where these jobs can be very monotonous, mundane, repetitive.” That’s why solutions like Wootzano’s are so vital. Not only do the speed of the robots match that of humans, they also have cost parity. That’s right, the pricing is actually equivalent to hiring a human being. Present on the panel was also Suraya Abdul Rashid, who invented a solution that is being sold by the company she founded, Qarbotech. She used quantum dot technology to create a solution that helps plants grow better. In late 2023, the company received US$700,000 in seed funding and grants to scale. The round was led by 500 Global, while the grants came from the Singaporean government-linked Temasek Foundation, and Malaysia’s Khazanah Nasional. “Photosynthesis is an inefficient process,” she said. “Only 2% of light is being utilised during photosynthesis. So what we have is a photosynthesis enhancer.” Essentially, Qarbotech’s solution helps plants absorb more light, hence increasing plant growth and yield. While yield enhancers aren’t completely novel, Qarbotech’s solution puts smallholder farmers in the spotlight rather than sidelining them as it’s very easy to understand and implement. As Suraya pointed out, in SEA, there are an estimated 100 million smallholder farmers. When they are exposed to climate crises such as prolonged monsoons and hot weather, they end up experiencing a huge drop in their productivity. And that means, for the average farming family, less food on the table, and less money for education and health, trapping them in the poverty cycle. So, we’ve got three companies doing cool stuff in the agritech sphere. So what? Obviously, there is much still to be done. Many more gaps can be filled in the market, as pointed out by another panellist, Singapore-based Tin Men Capital’s Murli Ravi. He pointed out that the other panellists mainly focused on on-farm solutions that touch on life sciences, robotics, IoT, and the like. But he said there are lots of ways tech can be applied to pre and post-farm operations. We must look at the entire value chain, from supply to financing to retail. One key thing he advised looking into as well is waste reduction. “I think the world has enough crops to feed everybody, but we also know there are many people who are starving out there,” he said. “And the reason for that is not because we don’t have enough crops today. We don’t actually need to get more farms. We need to reduce wastage.” But all in all, the panellists agreed that Southeast Asia is primed for lots of innovative growth when it comes to agritech, and Malaysia is of course at the centre of it all. But to get us to the next chapter, there needs to be more integration and unity within the ecosystem. Jay said that there is an “us versus them” sort of mentality within the industry, referring to startups and traditional businesses. “Agritech, this whole tech thing, is seen as an external thing,” she said. “We need to be seen as integrated as one, solving a problem across the value chain. That kind of ecosystem is fundamental.” Another player that must come in is the government. Atif said that the government must help to derisk agritech efforts in order to enable the integration of said technology. “We actually have such few companies that have succeeded in agritech compared to fintech or ecommerce in this region particularly,” Jay said. “And it’s simply because technology has been seen as an add-on bling in a way.” So many players in the industry from farmers to corporates still lack awareness and education for agritech solutions. The harsh reality is that we need agritech, not just from an economic standpoint, but from a survival standpoint. Agritech is needed to tackle issues with food security and the climate. And as the industry comes together to solve those issues, Malaysia and the world will be all the better for it.

But one crop that commonly gets left out is dragon fruit. Despite not being native to the country, it’s a fruit that the people of Sepang are more than familiar with. The township has about 181.45ha of dragon fruit farms based on The Star’s report last year. And one of the more notable ones is HL Dragon Fruit Eco Farm, which sports a Guinness World Record for its large dragon fruit structure. “We aimed to build a landmark in Sepang because dragon fruit is very well known here, but we didn’t have a structure to represent it,” Eugene Chia, the eco farm’s managing director, told us while we dined at its in-house restaurant. To rectify this, they built “Malaysia’s Largest Dragon Fruit Shaped Structure” in 2020. A year later, it was awarded by The Malaysia Book of Records, followed by the Guinness World Record in late 2023. Standing at over 9m tall, the structure was erected in hopes of boosting the local tourism industry. And so far, it seems to be working. On most weekends and public holidays, you’ll find tourist buses and families driving up HL Dragon Fruit Eco Farm’s gravel roads. Many of them are part of private agency-based tour groups and visit the farm for its agrotourism activities. There, you can personally take part in dragon fruit planting and harvesting. Some of its tourism packages even allow you to help pollinate the fruit’s flowers which only bloom at night. It’s not a revolutionary offering per se, as other fruit farmers in Malaysia have leveraged this to expand their businesses. Just look at how those in Cameron Highlands market their strawberry-picking activities. But in Sepang, you could say that HL Dragon Fruit Eco Farm is pioneering this business model. Although only in his late-20s, Eugene, who is the youngest child of three, has been in the family business for years. Even before officially joining the company in 2020, he was already helping out part-time during his studies. Hence, he’s been paying attention to what the other farmers in the area offer. He found that many of them focus more on the plantation itself without delving too much into the agrotourism sector. This makes the fresh fruit’s market competition quite tight at times. So to set the brand apart, Eugene and his family introduced agrotourism at HL Dragon Fruit Eco Farm. Part of this includes collaborating with other local businesses like cafes to promote each other during the packaged tours. The brand also partners with other dragon fruit sellers in the area by buying their supplies. In other words, the eco farm has created a network that serves the local community. Aside from that, Eugene explained that they work with the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security to conduct research on growing higher quality fruits. Afterwards, they’ll have sharing sessions with local farmers to spread their learnings. Sometimes, if farmers in the area need help with selling their crops, Eugene and his team would assist in marketing them. While we were there, we found them selling durians from the orchards of others. One reason HL Dragon Fruit Eco Farm runs more like a business than a plantation is because it’s helmed by a businessman. Eugene’s father, Sam Chia, was previously running his own construction company. Then he left that behind in search of greener pastures and founded this dragon fruit business with his wife, Lydia Goh Siew Lan, in 2014. Together, their mindset since the start was to look at it as more than just a plantation. This spirit was passed onto Eugene and his two elder sisters who are actively involved in the eco farm too. When the pandemic happened, it gave way for them to further tap into being innovators in the market. “If we just do farming, the price is determined by the market. We can’t control it. So we wanted to do something special then we came up with these new [processed dragon fruit] products that don’t have that much competition,” Eugene shared. For example, the brand creates dragon fruit enzymes that can be mixed with beverages (RM58) or made into soup (RM18). They also turned dragon fruit flowers into ready-to-eat sambal sauce (RM18). To try these products before purchasing, visitors can dine at their in-house restaurant that serves a variety of dragon fruit-based food. Some must-try signature dishes include its Dragon Fruit Curry Bun (RM30 for M size), Dragon Fruit Nasi Lemak (RM18.90), and Braised Dragon Fruit Ginger Seafood Noodle (RM25.90). While speaking to Eugene, we learnt that his family has much bigger ambitions for the brand, although these plans cannot be publicly revealed yet. For a teaser, the business will be growing its agrotourism vertical. Currently, they’re continuing R&D to create new products like their Dried Dragon Fruit Slices (RM14.90 per pack). This is how HL Dragon Fruit Eco Farm plans on making a global name for itself. “We’re working with the ministry and universities [like Universiti Putra Malaysia] to come up with these,” Eugene explained. “Hopefully, we can distribute [and export] them everywhere and the world will know us.” So far, it’s been about a decade since HL Dragon Fruit Eco Farm first started and business continues to grow. But this doesn’t come without its own set of hurdles, of course. Being a family business has its challenges at times, particularly when two different generations are in the mix. How they make it work is by coming together to discuss ideas and decisions, respecting and learning from each other. “Our parents are more experienced in the industry and business world. For myself, I’m someone who wants to do more innovation and create new products,” Eugene shared. His mother, who likes to cook, came up with all the restaurant’s recipes. By harnessing each other’s passions and strengths, the brand has come a long way since the beginning. With its upcoming plans, it’s likely that we’ll be hearing some big expansions soon. Until then, though, I’m personally content with visiting the farm again to try its agrotourism activities.

According to the World Bank, it’s crucial to a nation’s economic growth, accounting for 4% of global gross domestic product (GDP). In some developing countries, it can even go as high as accounting for more than 25% of a country’s GDP. But putting numbers aside, the local agricultural sector is directly linked to the state of a country’s food security. Without stable food production on a local level, countries would have to rely heavily on importing goods. And as the pandemic has shown, it’s not a feasible solution in the long run. When travels were halted and international borders were closed, the food supply chain was disrupted and exposed more people to the food crisis. Realising this, serial entrepreneur Gerard Lim started Agroz Group Sdn Bhd—an agritech company focused on using technologies to ensure food safety, food security, and sustainability in the local agriculture sector. Speaking candidly to Vulcan Post, Gerard shared that he caught the agritech bug about seven years ago. At the time, he was leading Atilze Digital, an Internet of Things (IoT) and data analytics company that implemented solutions for farmers, like smart fertigation systems. Dictionary time: Smart fertigation is a fertiliser application method, in which dissolved fertilisers are delivered to crops through the irrigation system. While designing and building solutions for chilli farmers, he saw the need to use technology to improve issues and challenges in the field. “[I] found that agriculture was using lots of dangerous chemicals, and food was not safe,” he explained. “The situation of food insecurity is worsening across the world. And many traditional farming techniques are not sustainable.” So he launched Agroz Group in an effort to grow better produce and improve Malaysia’s food supply, using various tools like IoT, data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), automation, 5G communication, and more. That said, Gerard told Digital News Asia back in 2020 that the brand’s aim goes beyond farming. It is also about the best use of technology to disrupt the entire business model to match demand with supply in the food industry. And one way the brand does this is through its controlled-environment agriculture (CEA) indoor vertical farm. CEA indoor vertical farming refers to vertical farms that are designed with technology to provide optimal conditions for plants. This includes the ability to control factors like temperature, lighting, and humidity to allow farmers to grow plants that might not usually be suitable for a location’s climate and weather. Aside from that, this method of agriculture has little to no need for using pesticides as the controlled environment naturally keeps out pests, thereby making it a safer option for consumers in the long run. Plus, CEA vertical farms can be flexibly built anywhere because there is no need for arable land. They can be on apartment rooftops, in corporate warehouses, or even inside a mall. In August 2023, Agroz Group opened the doors to its EduFarm-in-City in AEON Alpha Angle, a CEA indoor vertical farm that doubles as an educational spot for locals. There, you’ll find weekend workshops and experiential learning sessions where children, students, and families can have hands-on sessions to understand how vegetables are grown from seedlings. They can also harvest their own vegetables directly from the Agroz grow modules. You can then use these freshly harvested greens to make a bowl of mixed salads or sandwiches on the spot, showcasing the concept of farm to fork. Some of the greens you can find there are common grocery needs like lettuce, kale, arugula, wild rocket, nai pak, and siew pak choy. It’s one way the brand creates awareness and teaches how modern and sustainable farming can be achieved in the city. “We wanted to inform especially children and students how quality food, in particular vegetables, are grown fresh and clean without pesticides right in our neighbourhood,” Gerard stated. At the same time, he shared that the commercial CEA indoor vertical farm also produces approximately 150kg of vegetables daily. Part of that is supplied to and sold at nine AEON supermarkets across the Klang Valley. At 8,000 sq ft, Agroz’s EduFarm-in-City is said to be Malaysia’s largest indoor vertical farm inside a shopping mall. And it’s actually an idea from AEON itself. Sharing with us, Gerard explained that in late 2021, AEON approached Agroz and several other indoor farming companies seeking proposals on what could be done at Alpha Angle. It was only in 2022 that a decision was made for a collaboration between AEON and Agroz to design, build, and operate the EduFarm-in-City. Gerard said that having it in this specific AEON outlet made “perfect sense” too. Located about 15 minutes from the KL city centre, it allows them to be closer to the city’s community. And AEON Alpha Angle was undergoing a physical transformation when the project started. This included the use of solar photovoltaic (solar PV) as a source of renewable energy across the mall. It’s been about two months since Agroz’s EduFarm-in-City launched and the brand reported that acceptance has been good so far. On a daily basis, they host several dozen visitors and several workshops. And recently in late October, Agroz introduced its Farm-in-Supermarket at AEON MaxValu Prime at Bangsar South’s The Sphere. So AEON shoppers and visitors can directly harvest their own fresh Agroz vegetables and add it straight into their shopping cart. With all that said and done, Gerard explained that the main goal of Agroz is to complement traditional farming with high-tech indoor vertical farms while also offering solutions to embrace technology in traditional farms. Hence, helping them modernise and transform how farming can be conducted in a safer and more sustainable manner. “Agroz’s mission is to see that traditional farmers adopt technology in their farming practices to improve quality, boost yield and productivity, and ensure consistency,” the founder stated. Of course, it’s easier said than done as digitalising any industry will take time with adoption rates being the way they are. But on a brighter note, he shared Agroz has successfully raised funding from various strategic investors and institutions. “This has placed us on a strong footing financially as well as charted our pathway to an IPO on Nasdaq in 2024.” Also Read\\nLearn how to leverage cloud solutions for your biz by joining this free webinar in November Featured Image Credit: Agroz Group Sdn Bhd'}, {'url': 'https://vulcanpost.com/839047/cell-agritech-malaysia-cultivated-meat-lab-grown-startup/', 'title': 'With RM35mil invested so far, this startup is bringing us closer to M’sian lab-grown meat', 'body': 'Lab-grown meat has always sounded like something of the distant future to me. However, it seems like the future has already arrived in Malaysia in the form of Cell AgriTech, a local startup that’s all about cultivated meat. For Cell AgriTech’s manufacturing vice president, Jason Ng, cultivated meat is not just some cool futuristic technology, but an answer to very current issues. He pointed out that fundamental necessities for human survival and wellbeing are food and healthcare. In both, biotechnology plays a transformative role. Cell AgriTech primarily tackles the “food” part of the equation. Jason pointed out that with the world’s population growing steadily, the demand for sustainable and nutritious food sources has never been higher. “I saw animals being killed for food. I saw hunger,” he said. “Biotechnology provides us with the tools to enhance crop yields, develop drought-resistant varieties, and even produce foods with better nutritional profiles.” Using stem cells, biotechnology has made cultivated meat possible, presenting a new food option that uses limited resources in a manner that’s both environmentally friendly and ethically sound. “In a world grappling with both scarcity and disease, biotechnology offers hope, promising a brighter, healthier, and more sustainable future,” Jason expressed. “It reminds us that even within the smallest of cells lies the potential to change the world.” After observing some cultivated meat companies abroad successfully produce meat without the need for serum-based media, Jason decided to start Cell AgriTech. But how is meat even cultivated? Describing the process, Jason shared that it begins with the extraction of a small sample of\\xa0cells, usually muscle\\xa0cells, from a living animal. These extracted\\xa0cells\\xa0are placed in a bioreactor with a culture medium. As these\\xa0cells\\xa0mature, they form muscle or fat tissues by placed around a scaffold that helps them attain the texture and structure of actual meat. When the tissues have grown to a desired level, they are harvested, processed, and prepared in a similar way to conventional meat. The culture media typically consists of a mix of amino acids, sugars, salts, and vitamins. Additionally, growth factors, which were originally sourced from fetal bovine serum, are required. “However, due to ethical, cost, and scalability issues, we are shifting to serum-free alternatives,” Jason explained. As such, Cell AgriTech primarily focuses its R&D efforts on scaling up and enhancing manufacturing processes. This includes speeding up\\xa0cell\\xa0growth and achieving better yield rates. One big question people may have about cultivated meat is how it stacks up against traditional meat. There may be concerns about the nutritional value of it considering its “lab-grown” nature. However, Jason said, “I believe the nutritional profile of cultivated meat surpasses that of traditional meat.” He explained that this is because when vitamins are administered to livestock, they aren’t fully absorbed. However, when these vitamins are introduced directly to\\xa0cells, absorption is more efficient. “As a result, the nutritional content of cultivated meat is not only consistent but can also be tailored to specific needs,” he concluded. When it comes to the taste, he shared that the flavour of cultivated meat closely mirrors that of traditional meat, given that it originates from the\\xa0cells\\xa0of conventional meat sources. However, he did say that the texture may differ. This is as by enhancing the density of the cultivated meat, Cell AgriTech can actually further refine both the meat’s texture and taste. “But at this moment, we are still in the process of meeting the density and texture of traditional meat but I believe we can achieve it within two to three years’ time,” he said. Cell AgriTech’s operations are based in Kulim High\\xa0Tech\\xa0Park, where it has established a\\xa0cell\\xa0culture laboratory. This setup is an interim measure before their upcoming factory in Penang that’s worth RM20 million. A significant portion of this capital primarily comes from the directors, Jason disclosed. “We selected Penang because of its advanced medtech industry, and additionally, all of our team members hail from there,” Jason said. He also shared that Cell AgriTech’s initial investment stands at RM35 million, and the team anticipates the total investment to reach up to RM105 million. At present,\\xa0Cell\\xa0AgriTech\\xa0has successfully developed a minimum viable product, but has chosen to withhold its launch until the factory becomes operational, to ensure the team can produce at a cost that aligns with their financial projections. “In terms of sustaining the business during this phase, we’ve taken the route of self-funding, investing our own resources to keep our operations moving forward,” he said. He revealed that Cell AgriTech is collaborating with several renowned canned food manufacturers and hotels as the company gears up for a future product launch. While Cell AgriTech may be the first in Malaysia pushing for cultivated meat, there are many companies worldwide that are doing the same. Jason shared that while the fundamental principles of meat cultivation might be similar, the uniqueness lies in the details. Each company, due to its proprietary technologies and methodologies, produces cultivated meat with distinct characteristics. “Moreover, our approach to technology and manufacturing cost allows us to have a unique cost structure,” he said. “So, while the overarching concept is alike, the nuances in our product differentiate it in the competitive landscape.” Rather than considering industry players to be in competition with one another, he believes they’re all collaborating to collectively advance the industry. While Cell AgriTech may not be in direct competition with others in the same industry, cultivated meat as an industry may be seen as a threat to the traditional meat industry. To that, Jason shared, “While we’re enthusiastic about the potential of cultivated meat, it’s important to clarify that our intention is not to replace traditional meat or displace farmers.” “We recognise and value the integral role farmers play in our food system. As the population burgeons, with Malaysia alone projected to see a growth of around two million people in coming three years, the demand for meat will undoubtedly rise.” As traditional methods alone may not be able to meet this demand, that’s where cultivated meat comes in—not as a replacement, but as an alternative solution to help bridge this upcoming supply gap. While it’s a common perception that Malaysians might not be early adopters of novel technologies like cultivated meat, the Cell\\xa0AgriTech\\xa0team views this challenge as an opportunity for education and awareness. To bridge the knowledge gap, Cell Agitech has initiated funding for cultivated meat courses in local universities. However, one of the significant hurdles Cell AgriTech is facing are religious concerns. To ensure all the products align with religious laws and are halal, the team is working closely with related parties. Jason also said that USM, UTM, and UPM are forming a consortium in developing cultivated food halal guidelines and standards. Another challenge involves supply chain constraints. As Malaysia’s current ecosystem for cultivated meat is still developing, many of the specialised components needed aren’t readily available domestically. While the goods can be imported, this adds to Cell AgriTech’s operational costs. Understanding that Malaysia’s cultivated meat industry is still in its nascent stages, the startup is playing to its strengths by focusing on manufacturing instead of technology. “By leveraging this expertise, we can make significant leaps in the cultivated meat sector, especially in terms of production scalability and cost efficiencies,” Jason said. Overall, Jason seems to have big ambitions for the company and the industry at large. The team hopes to set up a contract development and manufacturing organisation (CDMO) to push other businesses and startups to embark on their own cultivated meat ventures. Furthermore, the team hopes to develop Malaysia’s first commercial cell bank and form a cellular agriculture association. “To bring these plans to fruition, we’re committed to harnessing strategic partnerships, persistent public outreach, and a fusion of cutting-edge technology with industry best practice,” he said. “With unwavering dedication, the right alliances, and a forward-thinking approach, we’re confident that\\xa0Cell\\xa0AgriTech\\xa0will be at the helm of redefining the future of food in Malaysia and beyond.” Also Read\\n2 innovative startups that won RM580K+ from this Hong Kong incubator that’s now in M’sia too Featured Image Credit: Cell AgriTech'}, {'url': 'https://vulcanpost.com/852840/aerodyne-dronedash-cross-border-malaysia-singapore-drone-deliveries/', 'title': 'Finally, cross-border drone deliveries can take off in M’sia with this Aerodyne partnership', 'body': 'Are we witnessing the takeoff of commercial drone deliveries in the region? Malaysian dronetech startup Aerodyne Group (Aerodyne) has inked an agreement with Singapore-headquartered DroneDash Technologies (DroneDash), a press release announced. This initiative is set to introduce cross-border drone delivery services between Malaysia and Singapore. Leveraging the specialised technologies of both companies, such deliveries will boost logistics efficiency across the two countries, which will in turn advance the region’s delivery and supply chain capabilities. According to the press release, Aerodyne and DroneDash are working to navigate the regulatory framework, securing all necessary permits to pioneer shore-to-shore drone operations along the Malaysia-Singapore corridor. As a start, the initiative will focus on establishing delivery routes from Singapore to Johor Bahru and Iskandar Malaysia. This phase sets the foundation for future expansion throughout Malaysia, with commercial operations anticipated to start in the third quarter of 2024. The drones will be capable of carrying up to 30 kilograms, achieving speeds of 150 km/h within a four-hour flight span. Specifically, the service is designed for critical deliveries such as urgent documents, high-value electronics, medical supplies, and perishable foods. The solution will provide real-time tracking, advanced security protocols including 256-bit encryption, and blockchain technology for logistical oversight. A familiar name to not just Malaysia’s drone industry but the globe’s, Aerodyne has been ranked as the world’s number one drone service provider for three consecutive years by Drone Industry Insights. The company is described as a 360DT3 drone-based enterprise provider, which means they have a holistic approach to Drone Tech, Data Tech, and Digital Transformation. Helping organisations overcome complex industrial challenges by leveraging drone data and AI-powered analytics, the Cyberjaya-based company has been a unicorn-hopeful startup with plans to debut in the public share market. On the other hand, DroneDash is an air mobility infrastructure company based in Singapore that “aims to unlock the full potential of drones for transformative benefits and use across multiple sectors of the economy”, the press release stated. According to its website, the company offers solutions in three main areas—training, logistics, and technology. “Organisations in the logistics, cargo delivery, and freight services sector stand to gain a double-digit percentage improvement in overall productivity and cost,” said Paul Yam, CEO of DroneDash, about utilising drone technology. “Drone deliveries are also beneficial for the environment with emissions and carbon footprint being reduced by up to 100% and 80% respectively.” Furthermore, drone deliveries are especially helpful in reaching remote areas where traditional air and sea freight are unable to access. “With the formation of the recent Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone (JS-SEZ), we are proud to play a part in strengthening economic connectivity between the two regions,” said Mudzakkir Hatta, the Malaysian COO of Aerodyne. “We look forward to venturing beyond the state of Johor with increased shipments to other parts of Malaysia, forging a longstanding trade cooperation with the two partnering nations.” With this major development, a future where drones are commonly used for our day-to-day deliveries seems to be not too far off.

They envisioned a promising concept: Packages containing products, from toothpaste to smartphones, would be brought to customers’ doors or lawns by a drone. The drone would land, deliver the package, then fly away. However, this hasn’t taken off commercially. Locally, companies like AirAsia’s Teleport have shared their ambitions of rolling out drone deliveries to streamline ecommerce logistics. Such plans have remained in pilot testing for years now, with no official news of when Malaysians can expect to see our skies filled with parcels to be dropped off. What happened? In partnership with Malaysian Research Accelerator for Technology & Innovation (MRANTI), we invited local dronetech experts to share their input on why drone deliveries haven’t taken off in Malaysia. Our interviewees comprised representatives from Universiti Kuala Lumpur’s Malaysian Institute of Aviation Technology (UNIKL MIAT), Malaysia UAV Drones Activist Society (MUDAS), along with the nation’s official drone, UAS, and aviation regulator, Civil Aviation Authority of Malaysia (CAAM). While commercial drone deliveries haven’t been commercialised, it’s worth highlighting that they have been tested in Malaysia. In February 2021, DHL and Malaysia Aviation Group’s cargo subsidiary collaborated on a pilot project to deliver medical supplies to remote areas in Sarawak. They used a drone to transport blood samples, vaccines, and medical equipment to rural communities, bypassing challenges posed by limited road infrastructure. During the 2021 and 2022 flood relief operations led by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MOSTI), Malaysian drone service providers were instrumental in delivering vital supplies to flood-stricken remote areas. These areas were otherwise inaccessible due to the floods, and MRANTI served as the lead agency in coordinating the Special Drone Services Emergency Task Force (PTK2Dron). CAAM highlighted another case study involving the delivery of medical supplies from a hospital to an urban residential area. To drop off the supplies, the drone utilised a parachute system which allowed for safe emergency landings. This minimised the risks of damaging the drone, payload (items being carried), or anything on the ground. Why have such players been given approval for drone deliveries, though? “These projects were conducted as pilot programmes or under specific approvals by the relevant authorities,” said Dr Hazariah Mohd Noh, a deputy dean, senior lecturer, and researcher from UNIKL MIAT. “In many cases, regulatory bodies may allow certain projects to proceed on a trial basis to assess the feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of drone deliveries in specific use cases, such as transporting medical supplies to remote areas.” CAAM added that such permissions are usually granted for a limited time and under specific conditions as mentioned in the Civil Aviation Directives (CAD). More specifically, the CAD 6011 Part V: Special UAS Project, highlights that drone service providers are expected to demonstrate strict adherence to safety protocols and regulatory requirements during the trial phase. The mass adoption of drone deliveries can be expensive. To keep up with the promise of speedy deliveries, ecommerce companies might have to build specialised drone delivery facilities to meet faster delivery promises. That would also mean having more cost-intensive warehouses and potentially more employees. Practically, for drone deliveries to take off, service providers have to prove that they can offer a cost-competitive edge compared to land-based methods such as motorbikes, cars, and lorries. Automation could therefore be a key factor in lowering the cost of drone deliveries. This will have to come alongside developing drones that can carry more payload and fly longer distances with better batteries. With such features, delivery drones could reduce the need for human drivers, and therefore lower fuel consumption associated with traditional delivery vehicles. William Alvisse, Secretary of MUDAS pointed out that the commercialisation of drone deliveries could have an impact on nature, and subsequently human welfare. For example, widespread drone operations could contribute to noise pollution, especially in urban areas. Thus, regulators are still researching the environmental and social impact of drones, which CAAM noted is a crucial area to consider in their guidelines. With proper planning and optimisation, large-scale drone deliveries could offer a greener alternative to traditional delivery methods. This is because drones run on electricity and produce lower emissions during operation, which could contribute to a cleaner transportation system. Like any emerging tech, the public may view the novelty of drone deliveries with an air of distrust. “The worst thing that could happen to the industry to elevate the public’s distrust is a series of high-profile accidents at launch,” CAAM said. Manufacturers and regulators must strive for perfection, which relies heavily on the safety features equipped on drones. “The technology would require an autonomous drone which is equipped with artificial intelligence (AI) able to reliably identify a clear landing zone,” CAAM explained. Delivery drones must also have obstacle avoidance features to avoid any objects in their delivery path, be they a person, building, or animal such as birds. “The drones must also have backup features that can mitigate other potential risks,” added William. Taking notice of this area, CAAM assured that regulators are still determining how packages can be dropped off safely. “Various delivery methods have been proposed, such as hovering the drone at a safe height above the destination and lowering the package via a cord, a parachute dropping the parcel onto the landing area, or employing dedicated delivery stations,” CAAM shared. For now, the safety of delivery drones is something that’s still being worked out, along with a form of insurance coverage in the unfortunate scenario where damages are caused by a delivery drone. Advocacy initiatives such as those conducted by associations like MUDAS are vital in educating the public and communities to give them a better understanding of dronetech. Will they be individuals, SMEs, ecommerce platforms, corporations, or dedicated logistics companies? The interviewees concurred that if every drone operator flies their drones at once, it can lead to airspace congestion between drones and other aircraft, such as aeroplanes and helicopters. Hence, aerospace regulators are still determining the proper flight paths, or “Drone Highways” for delivery drones. Dr Hazariah also brought up an interesting point. “From an industrial and corporate perspective, if drone deliveries are made available to all parties, it may result in unfair competition, especially for SMEs.” CAAM chimed in, highlighting that businesses could face challenges such as quality control and customer satisfaction in their delivery experience. In such a scenario, it may then be necessary for third-party logistics companies to be the ones providing drone delivery services between businesses and consumers for a more even playing ground. That way, drone delivery prices can be determined by dedicated logistics players, and consumers who opt for drone deliveries will be the ones bearing the shipping costs. As dronetech is an emerging industry, global government agencies and aviation authorities are still coming up with comprehensive regulations to ensure the safe and effective integration of drones into various sectors. It’s likely that Malaysia will only see developments in drone deliveries after they are rolled out globally first. That was noted by Associate Professor Ir. Abu Hanifah Haji Abdullah, a retired Airworthiness Engineering and Management Research Leader from UNIKL MIAT. He elaborated that all aviation activities are subjected to compliance with the standards published by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). “For the case of drone deliveries, the legislation framework does not officially exist yet in the world. However, CAAM has published provisions to legislate drones for research and development activities,” Prof Abu added. However, MRANTI is positive that drone delivery operations will be operational and commercialised sooner than people might think. That’s according to Wan Mohd Farhan, MRANTI’s Head of DroneTech who’s also facilitating missions under the Malaysia Dronetech Action Plan 2022-2023 (MDTAP30). “We are being updated by the authorities and solution providers that there are multiple drone delivery pilots currently being tested in the healthcare, as well as the oil and gas industry,” Farhan told Vulcan Post. “With the current CAD being observed and risk mitigations complied by the drone operators, as well as the UAS Traffic Management system deployed, we could see the commercial deployment of drone delivery in Malaysia as soon as next year.” While this article has touched on a handful of areas that need to be addressed before drone deliveries can take flight, it doesn’t encompass the full picture brought up by the dronetech experts. This is especially so in terms of the technical aspects required of drones and their operators to safely deliver parcels. Questions still being discussed include: What’s the maximum weight of parcels a drone can carry? Which drones are suited for the job? What altitude should delivery drones fly at to avoid planes and other aircraft? Who will manage air traffic control for delivery drones? For now, our interviewees believe that once drone deliveries become more widespread, there will be a couple of industries that might be prioritised. Some examples include the transport of medical supplies, and shore-to-ship deliveries. As Malaysians await the day when we might get to experience the potential benefits of drone deliveries, drone hobbyists who still wish to practise their flying can do so within the guidelines of existing regulations. That is, avoiding no-fly zones such as Putrajaya, KLCC, public and high-risk areas like hospitals or industrial complexes, as well as ensuring that your drone flying permits are up to date. Meanwhile, those who wish to actively get involved in the development of Malaysia’s dronetech industry can get in touch with MRANTI.

In a press release, the company stated that it has secured its Certificate of Approval (COA) from the Civil Aviation Authority of Malaysia (CAAM). Classroom training will be run at AirAsia Academy in KL Sentral, while practical training will be conducted at the YMCA Kuala Lumpur field, adjacent to KL Sentral. The intended purpose of the training programme is to support Malaysia’s dronetech industry while also driving the drone delivery market. AirAsia will join Drone Academy Asia in being one of the few local remote pilot training organisations (RPTO) to win approval from CAAM for the accreditation. Leveraging its aviation background, the programme will be developed and supported with AirAsia’s existing resources in aviation. This includes its safety management system, crew resource management, along with the remote pilot training modules both in the class and out in the field. Previously, the company has teased that its logistics arm, Teleport, was testing out drone deliveries at Cyberjaya. This new accreditation is an update supporting the drone pilot project for the delivery of goods from AirAsia’s e-commerce platforms using automated drones. The UAS (unmanned aircraft system) has become an important element in many industries with its ability to drive cost effectiveness and numerous other efficiencies. Globally, the drone delivery industry has already taken off and is projected to reach US$7.388 billion by 2027, according to Group CEO of AirAsia Aviation Limited, Bo Lingam. Anyone can learn to fly, as the programme is open to the community and requires no prior experience. This is in hopes of benefitting Malaysia in having more qualified remote pilots to support the drone industry. At the same time, this will benefit AirAsia as the company’s Allstars (employees) will have another avenue to upskill. Other than pushing for the advancement of urban drone deliveries for the e-commerce industry, training up more drone pilots can potentially increase support to remote areas during natural disasters too. Commercial remote pilot training classes will begin from January 24, 2022, where registrations are open on AirAsia Academy’s website.

It’s a part of the current Global Accelerator Programme (GAP) held by the Malaysian Global Innovation & Creativity Centre (MaGIC), but more on this later. We spoke to PABLO AIR team lead, Derek Lee, to learn more about what their GAP involvement means for the company and for Malaysia’s dronetech industry. Launched in 2018, PABLO AIR already has a few notable drone delivery achievements under its belt. In December 2020, it made the news after its drones carried out a 50-mile (about 80.6km) journey from Incheon New Port to two islands, Yeonghuengdo Island and Jawoldo Island. The journey took 1 hour and 20 minutes and marked the longest drone flight made in Korea thus far. With it, emergency medicines and everyday items were successfully flown over. Prior to this, PABLO AIR had also carried out a 35.7-mile (about 57.5km) journey from Jejudo’s Seogwipo Port to Udo Port in 1 hour and 56 minutes. “Thanks to these successful demonstrations, we are launching the actual drone delivery services [for the] delivery of products in convenience stores and medical supplies in Q1 2022,” Derek said. The company also secured US$8 million in a pre-Series B round in July 2021, and announced that the funds would go towards global expansion. This means a potential expansion to Malaysia as well, which is one of the reasons why PABLO AIR joined GAP as part of Cohort 5. Each country has its own set of regulations regarding unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) such as drones. In Korea, PABLO AIR credited related government bodies for their support and assistance in making the drone delivery demonstrations work. But as it expands, it will have to find similar support from foreign governments. “Since it includes aviation regulation and law, it is highly restrictive and provides limited access to a foreign company,” Derek added. “To overcome this challenge, we are now approaching government authorities and corporate partners who can assist us in conducting proof of concept (POC) in Malaysia.” This is where MaGIC’s GAP comes in to help the company build its market strategy and expand its partners in Malaysia. An example of what PABLO AIR has been able to benefit from is knowledge about the National Technology and Innovation Sandbox (NTIS), which it is now in discussion with for future collaborations. While that solves one challenge for the startup, there is something else to consider too: the localisation of its solution. “For example, some countries might value our technology and service for medical supplies but the other countries might be more interested in small package delivery from a restaurant, or a logistics company who would like to replace their supply chain amount with our drone service,” Derek said. “As our solution is ultimately serving both corporations and customers (end-users), we need to aggressively adapt our business model and solution into a different country with different needs.” Following an expansion to Malaysia, Derek shared what PABLO AIR could contribute to our local dronetech industry. “As we were the first generation of drone startups in South Korea, we know [what] the Korean regulatory authorities have done to promote the industry, removing regulatory obstacles gradually.” “For example, if you would like to operate drones Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS), there are many different considerations implemented to approve the operation,” he said. Dictionary Time: BVLOS is a term relating to the operation of UAVs and drones at distances outside the normal visible range of the pilot (500m). BVLOS drone operations provide numerous advantages over regular line-of-sight flying, and are more cost-effective. With PABLO AIR’s experience and knowledge, Derek said they’d be honoured to work together with Malaysian regulators to shape policies. In order to push for the commercialisation of dronetech in Malaysia, collaboration will be crucial, and PABLO AIR’s demonstrations will be useful case studies to develop our industry further. Being that it’s still an untapped market too, there will be plenty of opportunities and benefits for local and international drone companies alike to reap.

Aonic (formerly Poladrone) was appointed today as the first authorised DJI Enterprise (DJI) Service Centre in Malaysia. For those unaware, DJI is a Chinese drone manufacturer and one of the world’s leaders in creating and marketing consumer and enterprise UAVs. Drone service centres that are authorised by DJI mean that the brand’s UAVs will continue to be warranted by DJI. This certifies that Aonic can provide the relevant knowledge and services to enterprise customers seeking on-demand technical and drone maintenance. Having a local service centre for enterprise drones will also reduce downtime as maintenance and repair can be done locally. Aonic has been manufacturing drones in Malaysia since 2016, and became a DJI Enterprise partner in 2017. To add, Aonic has also been running its own service centre in Kluang, Johor since last year for services like customisation and drone maintenance. Just like serving your car periodically, the centres are meant to ensure the drones can perform at their highest quality at all times. If they work as intended, users can have peace of mind when using the tech in their daily workflows. To date, Aonic has experienced rapid growth and now operates in five business verticals. They include agriculture, industrial, services, retail, and academy, aimed at providing a holistic ecosystem going beyond its core drone capabilities. The end-to-end drone solutions provider has steadily built its team of in-house experts comprising R&D, operation, maintenance, after-sales, software, and training. These are the factors that paved the way to Aonic’s appointment as the first authorised DJI Enterprise Service Centre, the team believes. Following this appointment, Aonic’s service centre will contain a team of DJI-trained drone technicians, along with the local startup’s in-house engineers. At the same event, Aonic also unveiled its new drone, DJI Mavic 3 Enterprise, which is part of DJI’s product line-up. The brand targets these UAVs to be the most affordable entry-level aerial drone for industrial usage. According to the press release, there are two versions, Mavic 3E and Mavic 3T. The drones are said to be compact, foldable, and weigh less than 1kg, making them easy to carry and deploy. The Mavic 3E model is designed to serve basic commercial needs capable of doing survey missions with centimetre-level mapping accuracy. Meanwhile, Mavic 3T has a camera system with a thermal sensor that allows its operators to make informed decisions after quickly identifying objects onsite. Malaysia is a significant drone market within the region as it is expected to contribute RM50 billion in GDP and 100,000 job opportunities by 2030. That’s according to a study by the Malaysian Research Accelerator for Technology & Innovation (MRANTI). With Aonic establishing itself as a notable player in the industry for Malaysia, the local startup will hopefully be able to propel significant developments in the dronetech scene.

This platform is designed to help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) easily access affordable halal goods while offering financial support and certification guidance, all in one place. It’s a major step forward for local businesses looking to expand their reach both locally and internationally, positioning Malaysia as a leader in the global halal market. The halal market is vast and growing rapidly. By 2030, it’s expected to be worth an impressive US$5 trillion globally, with Malaysia’s domestic market alone estimated to reach US$113.2 billion, it said in a press release today. However, while opportunities are immense, SMEs in Malaysia and neighbouring countries, such as Indonesia, Cambodia, and Singapore, face significant hurdles. High ingredient costs, complex certification processes, and limited access to working capital are just some of the challenges hindering their ability to grow. That’s where Salaam Market steps in, offering a seamless solution to these common pain points. At its core, Salaam Market is a one-stop digital platform that allows SMEs to source halal-certified products at competitive prices. By directly connecting businesses with suppliers, the platform cuts down on costs and eliminates the need for middlemen. One standout feature of the platform is the lack of minimum order requirements, making it easier for smaller businesses to access certified halal ingredients without the burden of large upfront investments. This flexibility is crucial for SMEs, which often operate on tighter budgets. With Salaam Market, businesses can also access financial services from Maybank Islamic, helping them overcome the financial barriers that have traditionally made it difficult to scale in the halal sector. Navigating the halal certification process can be daunting for SMEs, especially those aiming to expand internationally. Salaam Market integrates in-house halal certification guidance, simplifying the process and ensuring compliance with Malaysia’s JAKIM halal standards—which are internationally recognised. Beyond certification, the platform offers digital document management tools to make accessing halal markets—both locally and abroad—much more manageable. “Not only [does] Salaam Market align with the country’s goal to become a global leader in halal compliance,” said Aizat Rahim, Managing Director and co-founder of Borong, “We also worked hard to ensure it addressed the key challenges for SMEs, which are affordability, financing, and certification, through the support of Maybank Islamic’s financing solutions while also being supported by JAKIM’s halal certification.” As the global demand for halal products continues to rise, this collaboration ensures that Malaysia remains at the forefront of the industry, driving local businesses to new heights and enabling them to expand their reach across international borders.

The annual Smart City & Digital Economy Convention (SDEC) is back for its ninth year in October 2024. Hosted by the Selangor Information Technology and Digital Economy Corporation (Sidec), the conference will focus on themes in burgeoning industries. From semiconductors and AI to ecommerce, SDEC 2024 will bring you four days of non-stop insights, and it’s all part of what they’re calling their 3-in-1 Tech Conference of the Year. Happening October 16-19, 2024, at the Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre, Sidec is expecting to attract over 18,000 visitors and feature 200 exhibitor booths, showcasing both international and local companies. Here’s what you can learn there. Semiconductors (or SC, or semicon) is a massive industry that Malaysia is at the heart of. The industry’s growth is expected to reach an output of US$46 billion or RM212.52 billion by 2028. It’s no wonder Malaysia is considered an electrical and electronics (E&E) and semiconductor powerhouse—which convinced Tesla to set up shop here. “The industry has grown at an impressive CAGR of 16% since 1972, and while the last seven years have seen a slightly moderated growth of 10%, the sector remains a cornerstone of Malaysia’s economic landscape,” said Malaysia Semiconductor Industry Association (MSIA) President Dato’ Seri Siew Hai Wong at the Tech In Asia 2024 conference. And that’s exactly what SDEC 2024 wants to explore on the first day. Between 10AM to 5PM on October 16, you’ll get access to conferences diving into Malaysia’s IC Design industry, the convergence of AI and semiconductors, and the cultivation of semiconductor talent. Hear from local and global leaders from QES Group Berhad, STMicroelectronics, Weeroc, and AMD on these sessions planned for the day: The world is recognising Malaysia as an emerging data centre powerhouse in SEA, as demand surges for cloud computing and AI. Malaysia has attracted billions of dollars in data centre investments, including those from Microsoft’s US$2.2 billion (RM10.5 billion), Google’s US$2 billion investment (RM9.4 billion), and ByteDance’s RM10 billion (US$2.13 billion). And these are just in 2024 alone. AI isn’t just a buzzword; some would argue it’s a key driver of societal progress. Embracing it can help build a skilled workforce and give people access to diverse tech skills. This shift equips individuals to thrive in a digital world, boosting job prospects and fueling national growth. On October 17, SDEC 2024 will have a full day dedicated to educating you on the potential of AI. They’ve brought together speakers from Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft, SNS Network, and Taiwan AI Academy to speak on: The Department of Statistics Malaysia (DoSM) reported a 5.4% year-on-year increase in ecommerce revenue in Q3 2023, rising from RM274.6 million to RM289.5 billion. With over 30 million internet users in 2022, enhanced connectivity has paved the way for this digital shopping revolution, bolstered by a dynamic economy and rising digital literacy. So, what does this mean for you as a retail business owner? Huge opportunities. And the newer yet already booming ecommerce platform, TikTok Shop, should not be overlooked. TikTok reported that nearly 83% of Malaysian consumers turn to social entertainment platforms for shopping, prompting brands to engage their audiences with entertaining and educational content. TikTok also revealed that 59% of users indulge in retail therapy weekly, and 89% participated in Mega Sales Events last year. High-spending shoppers averaged US$265 (about RM1,100) during these events, driving a sixfold increase in conversions from discovery to purchase in Q2 2023. If you’re unsure how to leverage this opportunity, SDEC 2024 has you covered. Day three (October 18) features a TikTok Shop SME Digitalisation Conference, where SMEs can discover innovative ecommerce strategies and creative advertising solutions on TikTok Shop: The final day of SDEC 2024 will highlight the top 20 local startups specialising in AI, biotech, and sustainability, presenting their innovations to venture capitalists and industry experts. These startups have been part of Sidec’s Selangor Accelerator Programme (SAP), and the final day of SDEC 2024 marks their much anticipated Demo Day. Some of the startups that have previously been part of SAP include names familiar to Vulcan Post, such as Entomal Biotech, iMotorbike, and Virtualtech Frontier. Much like Sidec’s previous conventions, SDEC 2024 offers a valuable opportunity to drive innovation by showcasing cutting-edge technologies and their applications across various industries. Attending the convention means you’ll get to network with influential leaders, policymakers, and innovators from around the world, facilitating meaningful business matching sessions and collaborations.

Here’s how.', 'body': '[This is a sponsored article with ZenMarket.] ZenMarket’s founders didn’t plan on becoming personal shoppers, but every time they flew to Japan for their studies, friends and family would flood them with requests for snacks, figurines, and other Japanese goodies. You see, shopping overseas from Japan was a hassle—language barriers, tricky shipping, and confusing websites made it nearly impractical for most people. Spotting an opportunity, the four founders created a service that makes it easy for anyone to shop from retailers in Japan, with no Japanese address needed. That’s how ZenMarket started out operating from the team’s 50-square foot apartment in 2014. Just one year later, they expanded to a warehouse in Osaka. By 2016, they were shipping to global customers, showcasing that they had a winning idea on their hands. ZenMarket, part of the ZenGroup family, helps you seamlessly shop from Japan and have those goodies delivered right to your doorstep. This simplicity is exactly why the founders chose “Zen” to be part of the company’s name. They expanded to Malaysia in 2020, and operate in over 170 countries as of August 2023. The platform currently supports 19 languages, including Malay. So if you’ve ever been intimidated out of making a purchase by Japanese-only sites, ZenMarket has got you covered. With access to over 10,000 stores, you can explore everything from rare anime collectibles to premium skincare products. While first-time users of such a site might experience a slight learning curve, ZenMarket’s intuitive platform, detailed FAQ, tutorial blogs, and built-in Google Translate search support lower the barriers to entry. They also have a reliable customer support team who can assist you if you’re unsure of any product, or other shopping experiences. Once you’ve signed up, you can browse through online stores in Japan like Amazon, Rakuten, Mercari, Yahoo! Shopping, and many others directly on the site. If you’ve found something on a Japanese website that isn’t listed on ZenMarket, you can just paste the product’s URL into ZenMarket’s search bar, and you’re good to go. You’ll then get to specify details about the item you’re purchasing, such as the colour or size you’re looking for. And if you’re buying multiple units of the same product, you’ll only be charged one service fee, making bulk purchases more cost-effective. After your shopping spree, ZenMarket takes care of the rest by consolidating your purchases into one parcel at their Osaka warehouses. You can hold your items for up to 60 days for free, giving you time to add more before they’re shipped out. If you’re buying gifts or running a business, you can even request to reinforce your packaging or remove invoices and price tags from your parcels—ideal for dropshipping or personalising your gift. ZenMarket also has flexible payment options. You can choose to pay in Malaysian ringgit (converted from yen) and select from a variety of payment methods, including credit cards and cryptocurrency. Plus, ZenMarket rewards loyal customers with credits and up to 1% cashback on every purchase. ZenMarket isn’t just about offering a platform, they’re focused on making your shopping experience smooth and worry-free. With features like their photo service, you can request pictures of your items before they’re shipped, ensuring they’re exactly as expected. For those who are extra cautious, ZenPlus, a sister division of ZenGroup, provides a curated marketplace of vetted sellers, guaranteeing authenticity. A post shared by ZenMarket EN (@zenmarket_en) However, keep in mind that ZenMarket’s return and refund policies vary by individual store, so it’s essential to review these details before making a purchase. Additionally, be aware of customs regulations and ensure the products are eligible for shipping to your destination. Should any issues arise, ZenMarket’s customer support team is available to assist you throughout the process. As Japan faces a shrinking domestic market, there’s an increasing need to tap into global demand for Japanese products. That’s where ZenMarket comes in to bridge the gap between international shoppers and Japan’s vibrant ecommerce landscape. Whether you’re hunting for exclusive Japanese goodies or just want the ease of shopping abroad, ZenMarket simplifies the process. Furthermore, if you’re a first-time user, you can enjoy a 15% discount on international shipping for your first parcel by using the code OMOTENASHI2409 before the end of October 2024. Aptly, this campaign is named after the Japanese concept of “omotenashi,” or hospitality, ensuring that first-time customers receive a warm welcome into the world of effortless Japanese shopping.

It’s a leap year, which means we have an extra day in February. This only happens once every four years and gives you an extra day to complete all those new year resolutions. But it’s also cool for another reason. This year marks the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Malaysia and China. In celebration of this golden jubilee, Malaysia will be hosting the inaugural 2024 Malaysia E-Commerce Product Selection Expo. It’s set to be held from November 29 to December 1 at the Malaysia International Trade and Exhibition Centre (MITEC). Hosted by JMM Exhibition, this international event is organised in collaboration with the Malaysia Guangdong Chamber of Commerce (MGCC). The expo acts as a direct platform for Malaysian businesses and consumers to connect with Chinese manufacturers. Thus, further solidifying bilateral trade relationships. Here, Malaysian businesses will get to connect directly with Chinese brands and suppliers, eliminating intermediary costs and reducing logistics fees to enhance profitability. Retail consumers will also benefit from direct factory shipments. It’s a free-to-enter event for visitors. “2024 marks a golden milestone in Malaysia-China relations. In the first half of this year, bilateral trade reached US$100.232 billion, reflecting a 10.6% increase from the previous year and underscoring the deepening ties and vast potential of the partnership,” Ellison Yang, founder of JMM Holding (parent company of JMM Exhibition), stated. “China has been Malaysia’s largest trading partner for 15 consecutive years, and the recent visa-free policy has further boosted cultural and commercial exchanges between our nations.” Over 200 leading Chinese brands and SMEs across various sectors will be featured at the Malaysia E-Commerce Product Selection Expo. This includes those in the new energy, energy storage, domestic appliances, and smart home products industry. Visitors of the three-day expo are in for a comprehensive purchasing experience. Whether you’re a Malaysian business seeking bulk orders or a retail customer exploring a diverse range of products, this event is prepared to meet the needs of different attendees. However, the core focus of the expo will be on advanced technologies in China’s electronics sector, particularly new energy, such as solar photovoltaic, energy storage, and charging piles. According to the press release, these technologies are accelerating the green transition of electronic products. Or in other words, they’re sustainable electronics that are designed with the environment in mind. “Malaysia’s strategic location, multilingual capabilities, and cultural diversity make it an ideal gateway for Chinese companies entering the Southeast Asian market. With the production expertise and competitive pricing of Chinese businesses, this collaboration will significantly boost market penetration across ASEAN,” Ellis added. It’s projected that the inaugural Malaysia E-Commerce Product Selection Expo will attract over 15,000 visitors and generate RM60 million in trade transactions, marking a significant milestone in Malaysia-China trade relations. But more importantly, this event allows people from all backgrounds to explore new opportunities and experience the evolving landscape of Malaysia-China trade.

Some of my favourite features that I always highlight when recommending the platform is the unlimited cashback of 1% when using the GXBank debit card. Another thing is the 3.00% p.a. daily interest rate that they offer. Well, some important updates will be implemented that will affect these features. According to an email from GXBank today (September 6), there are two changes that they will be doing as the digital bank turns 2 years old: It’s not clear what they will be revising the cashback programme to, whether that be removing it entirely or lowering the percentage. They also did not comment on whether there will be changes to the zero ATM withdrawal fees and zero markups on foreign transactions that GX Card users have been enjoying. However, based on what they have shared previously, the waive is set to last until the end of this year (December 31, 2024). On their Facebook announcement detailing these changes, some netizens expressed dissatisfaction over the changes. Some pointed out that the new 2% p.a. interest rate is lower than many other options in the market, including offerings by traditional banks and digital banks alike. As a comparison, AEON Bank is offering 3.88% p.a. profit rates while Boost Bank is even offering up to 4.0% interest rates under special conditions. It is a shame that GXBank is lowering their interest rate, but that doesn’t diminish what they’ve achieved in the past year. GXBank shared that more than 800,000 Malaysians have earned almost RM29 million through their daily interest rates. Plus, it’s important to note that GXBank has always been clear that the GX Card’s 1% cashback on transactions with no cap would only last until November 5, 2024. Moving forward, GXBank will be working on new products such as its GX Flexi Credit, as well as financing solutions to support small businesses in Malaysia. GX Flexi Credit, which was announced in August this year, is essentially a line of credit designed to offer financial flexibility to its customers. The objective is to let users borrow with ease, paying interest only on the funds used. It’s also designed to be quick and hassle-free, with no need for paperwork and long waits for approval. This product is not yet launched yet. Instead, GXBank is inviting Malaysians to join the waitlist on their website. As a continual user of GXBank myself, I’m excited to see what’s next for the digital bank, even as these changes roll out. While the new 2.00% p.a. interest rate is less than ideal, I believe the new products in the pipeline are still worth keeping an eye on.

Tech conferences featured fintech professionals discussing the potential threats digital banking—”neobanks” or “banking challengers” as they called it at the time—would pose to incumbent banks. Several years have passed since then, and now three out of Malaysia’s five licensed digital banks are in operation. The Tech in Asia Conference 2024 in Kuala Lumpur brought together a panel of experts in the digital banking scene around SEA: They shared their views on the progress made and the future of digital banking in Malaysia. GXS Bank’s Group CEO stressed that simplicity is essential for serving underserved markets. Digital banking products are tailored to meet non-complex needs, as most people don’t require elaborate services early in their financial journey. The whole idea of digital banking is to give underserved and unbanked communities better accessibility to financial services. These groups consist of individuals who may not have access to services offered by traditional banks, such as having a minimum of RM20,000 deposited in their savings accounts to earn interest. “If you go to the big banks, there are a lot of complex terms and conditions to earn interest and most people don’t understand them, and why,” said Muthukrishnan. “The more of the underserved segment you go, the less financially literate they are. So what we’re trying to do as a digital bank is keep ourselves extremely simple.” Digital banks offered in Malaysia today have been shown to simplify this process by allowing customers to earn interest regardless of their account balance. This therefore bridges the gap for the underserved in accessing banking services. Malaysia’s digital banks tend to offer more competitive interest rates than traditional banks as well, thanks to lower customer acquisition costs, reduced service fees, and the absence of physical branches or salespeople. The payment landscape has changed drastically over the past decade. In 2017-2018, most transactions were cash-based, observed Boost CEO Shayentha, but the pandemic spurred a nationwide shift to QR payments. In fact, the convenience of QR payments has expanded across SEA countries, allowing Malaysian tourists in Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, China, and Korea to use their preferred mobile banking or e-wallet apps with participating merchants, and vice versa. “Now across markets, even when you look at small shops, they all use it too. So in terms of digitalisation and market adoption, this has helped bring inclusion to smaller businesses and consumers alike,” Shayentha shared. Regarding innovating under a regulated environment by the central bank, Shayentha stressed the importance of proactively working with regulators. He explained that Malaysia has a principle-based approach when it comes to launching new banking products. “If we’re doing something outside the norm, we need to define our compensatory controls, our risk appetite, and roll out a period of exposure for our new innovation,” he elaborated. Digital banks in Malaysia can test the benefits and risks of their innovations through government sandboxes, and further develop their solutions from there. “I would say that regulators in this region and in Malaysia have been all-encompassing of product innovation. So I don’t really think innovation will be a major issue moving forward,” Shayentha said. All the panellists agreed that market penetration in Malaysia’s digital banking landscape so far is strong, particularly in deposits and payments. So what’s next, in terms of providing greater financial inclusion to underserved communities? Over in the Philippines, Tonik Bank’s Sateesh noted that his digital bank primarily serves users by offering loans, seeing roughly a threefold increase in user uptake in the last year. “It’s what the underserved needs. Big banks involve a lot of paperwork the underserved may not have and a lot of time before they can decide to offer someone a loan,” he commented. With Malaysian digital banks now holding deposits from their users, both GXS Bank and Boost believe that offering loans to underserved markets will be the next step for their digital banks too. After all, it is the standard evolution most digital banks have taken, to offer deposits and then go into lending. “Once they get into the fray, they can help bridge the financial inclusion gap,” Shayentha said. “I can conclusively say that there was a gap before digital banking came about, and fintech has helped close the gap. Digital banking has helped provide a commodity that is under the regulatory umbrella, and they can provide it at scale, which can definitely help bridge the inclusion gap,” Muthukrishnan expressed. Sateesh addressed that while these financial services are offered to the underserved, building financial literacy in users still needs work. “Many people with smartphones don’t know what they have access to,” Sateesh highlighted, to which the rest of the panel echoed. Muthukrishnan believes that building the underserved markets’ financial literacy will be something digital banks will have to work on in the next two to three years. Ultimately, the growth of digital banks is driven by a singular goal, which GXS Bank’s CEO articulated with a single prompt: “How do you offer financial services to the underserved based on their current circumstances that the big banks won’t? That’s our positioning as digital banks.” Also Read\\nAI could bring in RM1 billion in revenue by 2030. Here’s how M’sian startups can get a cut.

During this time, I’ve been familiarising myself with the digital bank and its offerings. In fact, it saved me when I forgot my wallet and needed to withdraw some cash from the ATM, as it was the only card I had on me. (I did have to pay a RM1 service fee, though.) But that anecdote aside, here’s what my experience using AEON Bank over the past few weeks was like. The first question that one may ask when thinking of making a new account is: What’s in it for me? Off the bat, a big plus point is the profit rate of 3.88%, which is higher compared to the interest rate offered by the other digital banks currently available (GXBank and Boost Bank). The difference, though, is that AEON Bank will only deposit your returns at the end of the month. Aside from the profit rate, another way to “earn” is by spending. When spending with AEON Bank’s debit card, users will earn 1 AEON Point for every RM1 spent. On top of that, from now until August 31, 2024, users can earn 3x AEON points when spending with their debit card. That means if you spend RM100 during this promotional period, you’ll earn 300 points. With 200 points equalling to RM1, this is equivalent to a 1.5% cashback. There’s also an ongoing campaign right now whereby you’ll get 3,000 points (worth RM15) upon sign-up. As a frequent AEON shopper, it’s also nice to know that you can earn an extra point when shopping at AEON Stores, AEON MaxValu Prime, AEON Wellness, and AEON Big Hypermarkets. By displaying your AEON Points Programme membership barcode within the AEON Bank application to the cashier or self-service check-out scanner at the locations, you’ll be awarded an extra AEON Point for every RM1 spent. Currently, AEON Bank is waiving its one-year membership fee (RM12) for its AEON Points Programme. As you can see, a lot of these perks are being offered to early adopters, so if you’re hoping to get a piece of the rewards pie, you should join now. (No, I was not paid to say that.) And of course, the digital bank is Shariah-compliant, and the only one on the Malaysian market so far. That doesn’t just mean that Muslims will have ease of mind while using it—for non-Muslim users, you can also rest assured that this means the bank holds true to socially responsible practices, designed to prevent social harm while protecting individuals. Out of all the digital banks I’ve tried thus far, I will say that the branding and user interface of AEON Bank has been the most on point. This is a bit of a subjective thing, but I just love the bright, clean look and the adorable illustrations. Where apps like GXBank had given off a more tech-forward and alluring vibe, I adore the friendliness of the AEON Bank app. Another thing that this bank features is the Personal Financial Management tab that reminds me of the MAE app’s expense tab. Here, you can also access the Budget Centre, where you can add budgets for ATM withdrawals, Bills and Utilities, Retail & Shopping, F&B, and all sorts of other categories. On the topic of bills, AEON Bank actually enables users to pay bills directly through the app, which is a nice addition. However, the app doesn’t always categorise the payments accordingly. For example, my payment to a café was logged under “Groceries” and I can’t seem to be able to change that. Compared to GXBank, I would say AEON Bank’s app actually offers a more holistic experience and outlook on your finances, which is a great plus. Setting up an account on AEON Bank is super simple, as is with the other digital banks—ease of access is the name of the game, after all. Something cool about the setup process is that the bank gives you a chance to personalise the last four digits of your account number. I requested for 0001, and they actually gave it to me. Requesting for a physical card was super easy as well, and it arrived in my mailbox just a couple of days later. Activating it only takes a few taps on the app, and the card tab lets you adjust the card limit while offering other security features such as locking the card. One thing I have to comment on is that the card is so, so bright. I mean that literally. When I flash it, people tend to comment on just how loud it is. The fuchsia tone is quite glaring, yes, but I suppose it matches the rest of the app. Well, rest assured that you won’t ever lose it in your wallet. The app already has DuitNow QR transfers enabled, so even if you don’t have your card with you yet, you can still easily pay at most stores. You won’t earn any AEON Points when you pay via QR, though. All that said, there are a few downsides to the app so far that I’ve faced. The major one is that adding money into your account is not as seamless. Now, this might be a strategy to prevent you from overspending, but I personally find it to be a bit of a pain. Unlike Boost Bank and GXBank which has an easy “Add Money” button, there’s no such thing on the AEON Bank app. Instead, you’d need to DuitNow the money from another bank. No, it’s not the end of the world, but it certainly adds that extra bit of friction that could end up making or breaking your experience. In any case, AEON Bank has been promising thus far. I love the approachability of the app and its loyalty programme really is quite rewarding, especially during this promotional period. I’m excited to see more products being launched, particularly in the financing realm. It’ll be cool to see AEON Bank grow further into its mandate of Shariah-compliant financial inclusion.

Benefits of GXBank, AEON Bank & Boost Bank, compared.', 'body': 'Now that three digital banks have already launched in Malaysia, there’s one important question to be addressed: Which one should you download? Here’s a breakdown of the top USPs each digital bank offers so you can make your pick more wisely. Powered by Grab, GXBank was the first digital bank in Malaysia to launch to the public late last year. You can read our more in-depth review here. One of the biggest USPs of GXBank is its unlimited 1% cashback, which is why I deem it to be the best if you’re specifically looking for a new way to spend. The cashback is deposited daily. Another great perk is that the ATM fees are waived for all MEPS ATMs nationwide. For context, usually, if you’re withdrawing money from another bank operator’s machine, there’s a fee of RM1. As for the interest rate, though, it’s currently the lowest amongst the three options at 3.0% p.a. daily interest. Another perk is that users get 1.5x GrabRewards when paying with GXBank for Grab services or to shop at Jaya Grocer. What is the interest rate? 3.0% p.a. daily interest. Is there a card? Yes. Is there an ATM fee? No, it’s waived until December 31, 2024. Is DuitNow QR transfer supported? Yes. Out of the three digital banks available right now, AEON Bank has the highest returns with a profit rate of 3.88% p.a. for its savings account and Savings Pots. Keep in mind that this rate is just for the promotional period until August 31, 2024. However, it seems like AEON Bank doesn’t incentivise spending as much. That’s not to say it doesn’t incentivise it at all, though. With support for DuitNow QR, AEON Bank also offer perks such as 3x AEON Points collection when you spend with its debit card. However, it’s currently quite tricky to add money to the bank, compared to GXBank and Boost Bank, which both have an “Add Money” button. Instead, you’d need to DuitNow transfer from the bank account you’re transferring from. Read more about their features here. What is the profit rate? 3.88% p.a. daily interest, paid at the end of the month. Is there a card? Yes. Is there an ATM fee? Yes, RM1. Is DuitNow QR transfer supported? Yes. Boost Bank might be the latest to join this party, but it’s also a first in its own right. The first homegrown digital bank to launch in Malaysia, that is. One of the top pulls of Boost Bank is that it specifically serves the unbanked, not just the underbanked. What this means is that even people who don’t have a traditional bank account opened under their name can open a Boost Bank account online. It also incentivises saving by offering up to 3.6% p.a. interest rate after you deposit a minimum of RM2,000 in your Boost Bank savings account or Savings Jar, which ranks you up to Platinum President. This is a promotional interest rate valid from now until August 31, 2024, though. After that, it will go to a 3.2% p.a. rate. Platinum President users also get to receive 3x Boost Stars when they spend pay with the bank through Boost eWallet. The digital bank has also been teasing partnerships with well-known names like MYDIN and CelcomDigi, which will offer possibly higher interest rates or other promotional rewards. You can learn more about their features in this article. What is the interest rate? Up to 3.6% p.a. (depending on your account rank). Is there a card? Not yet. Is there an ATM fee? N/A Is DuitNow QR transfer supported? Not on the app, so you’ll have to use Boost eWallet. Like all financial solutions in general, the “best” one might differ from person to person depending on your own preferences and lifestyles. For example, if you’re already a loyal user of Grab, GXBank makes complete sense. As mentioned, it lets you earn 1.5x GrabRewards points on Grab services if you pay with the digital bank. You also get 1.5x GrabRewards when you shop at Jaya Grocer. Meanwhile, if you always buy your groceries from AEON, having AEON Bank would be ideal as it lets you collect 3x AEON points when you spend with the Debit Card. Users also get 3,000 AEON points off bat for their introductory campaign, which is worth RM15. As for Boost Bank, if you’re already a frequent user of Boost’s eWallet, it may make sense to use the digital bank as well. Once you’re a Platinum President user, you’ll earn 3x Boost Stars when you spend with the Boost eWallet, after all. So really, the answer for which bank is the best one isn’t set in stone. It’s great that there are multiple options in the market now for Malaysians to choose based on their own needs and wants. And hey, you can always try out all three to see for yourself. But as someone who is trying out all three digital banks currently, I’ll report back on which bank is the best fit for me, and why. Stay tuned!

Here are its benefits.', 'body': 'Another name has officially launched in the Malaysian digital banking scene, and this time, it’s a fully homegrown one. Boost Bank by Axiata and RHB launched today at an event officiated by our Prime Minister, Yang Amat Berhormat Dato’ Seri Anwar bin Ibrahim. This digital bank is one of five that was approved by Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) and the Ministry of Finance (MOF). Leveraging the expertise of Boost, the regional full spectrum fintech arm of Axiata, Boost Bank is pioneering what they call an “embedded onboarding journey”. What that means is that all existing Premium Wallet users on the Boost eWallet app can seamlessly open a Boost Bank account. The digital bank also taps into the expertise of RHB Banking Group (RHB). Boost Bank is the first digital bank in the market to merge the technology-first mindset of a fintech company with the trust and stability of a large financial institution. The Boost Bank app is already available for download on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. Creating an account is as simple as filling in personal details, then scanning the front and back of your IC. To be eligible, you must be a Malaysian citizen and at least 18 years old. Verifying those details typically only takes the app a few minutes. Something we’ve heard a lot with digital banks is that they all aim to cater to the underserved community. But what about the unserved community? As in, people who completely do not have any bank accounts to deposit money? Typically, for digital banks, you would need to perform a fund transfer to the new account from an existing bank account under your own name. Well, Boost Bank is actually one of the few banks in Malaysia that will enable users who do not have an existing bank account to be digitally onboarded. The only restriction is that such users will have a transfer limit of RM10,000. One of the starred features of Boost Bank is that users can enjoy daily interest rates of up to 3.6% p.a. with higher promotional interest rates with partners to be announced soon. This 3.6% p.a. interest rate is made available for users who are in the exclusive rank of “Platinum President”. To qualify for the rank, you would need to deposit a minimum of RM2,000 into Boost Bank’s Savings Jars and/or Savings Account. Savings Jars are basically similar to GXBank’s Savings Pockets and AEON Bank’s Savings Pots, designed to cultivate healthy saving habits. Where GXBank and AEON Bank have the same interest rates for their savings accounts and their savings Pockets/Pots, Boost Bank incentivises their Saving Jars with a higher interest rate. The Savings Account only goes up to 2.5% p.a. daily interest (if you’re ranked Platinum President). The 3.6% rate is a promotional one that will last from now until August 31, 2024, before turning to a standard 3.2% rate. Platinum President Boost Bank users will also automatically be upgraded to the highest rank on the Boost eWallet app. They can then earn up to 3x Boost Stars for every ringgit spent on eligible transactions once the accounts are linked. On that note, Boost Bank users cannot actually spend their money right now through DuitNow QR transfers, but can do so by linking the bank to the Boost eWallet app. There will also be upcoming partnership offers and additional rewards in the coming weeks called Partner Benefits, done in collaboration with Boost Bank’s partnered companies such as MYDIN. Users can potentially earn higher promotional interest rates with these Partner Benefits on Boost Bank’s partners’ Savings Jars. Other partnership promotions that users can look forward to across both West and East Malaysia include CelcomDigi, MYDIN, Bataras Sdn. Bhd., CKS RETAIL Sdn. Bhd., FARLEY (KCH) Sdn. Bhd., Servay Hypermarket (Sabah) Sdn. Bhd., and Boulevard Hypermarket and Departmental Store Sdn. Bhd. The interest is calculated based on the following formula: Daily Interest Earned = End-of-day Balance x (Interest Rate / Total Days of the Year). The interest earned is computed daily at 10 decimal points and paid out weekly at two decimal points. The end-of-day balance refers to the balance in your Savings Account and/or Savings Jar(s) at 23:59:59 on a given day. An upcoming product development from Boost Bank that is already in the pipeline is their debit card. At the launch, two colourways were showcased—one black and the other red. According to the roadmap, these retail debit cards are expected to be released in July this year. As the digital bank continues to grow, Boost Bank will expand its digital bank app features and products to better serve the needs of all Malaysians.

It could better support emerging technologies including AI, IoT, VR, and the like. Digital Nasional Berhad (DNB) was mandated by Malaysia’s Ministry of Finance (MoF) to deploy the country’s 5G network and infrastructure. While the 5G rollout is still underway, innovations can already be built to leverage the network and automate processes in various industries. Hence, the MYStartup Hackathon X DNB was held, calling upon Malaysian companies and teams to present ideas that address the needs of DNB. The hackathon was organised by MYStartup, an initiative by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MOSTI), and Cradle Fund. On January 18, 2023, three winners were chosen out of 111 teams, who pitched solutions to the problem statements: First up, we have Spacein Sdn Bhd (Spacein), a satellite manufacturing company that develops small satellites for IoT applications. Led by founder and CEO, Dr Norilmi, the team’s winning solution to the first problem statement is called Pocketqube Satellite Services (Pocketqube). It automates data collection, transmission, and distribution, using several small satellites orbiting around the plantation. This way, workers can constantly monitor the plantation, without physically visiting the remote location. “Automation will only work with connectivity, and DNB is looking for cost-effective, efficient, and stable connectivity using a 5G network,” said Dr Norilmi on Spacein’s winning solution. “Pocketqube fulfils this, and the platform is cost-saving. It’s stable, low maintenance, and the satellite’s height (between 400km and 700km from sea level) can easily cover any area of plantation in Malaysia.” Dr Norilmi shared that Pocketqube can be extended to oil and gas, too, especially for usage at oil rigs. Fleet and asset management is another industry that could benefit from Pocketqube. Next, we have carching, led by Jeshua Choong, who we’ve previously featured for its tech-driven car wraps. The team created LOOHcomotion at the hackathon, tackling problem statement number two to develop a dynamic advertising engagement platform. LOOHcomotion is a location-based software linked between a dynamic billboard and a brand’s platform. Here, brands can track the viewership of their billboard ads, and engage with drivers who’ve seen the ad. Think of them like ads you see on Waze when driving past a marked location, like getting a McDonald’s pop-up when you’re near the store. “With our solution, we can make billboards more engaging, more dynamic, and more importantly, data-driven,” Jeshua shared. “We think our solution leverages 5G’s network to help all parties unlock more value, without requiring heavy investments, as it’s relatively simple to implement. [What’s involved is] a brand’s advertising spend, drivers’ time wasted in traffic, as well as DNB and billboard owners’ infrastructure investments.” Center for Research and Development of IoT (CREDIT) is Asia Pacific University’s (APU) subsidiary that develops innovations utilising IoT and cloud engineering. Led by Narendran Ramasenderan, the head of CREDIT, the team tackled the third problem statement: develop a 5G-based AI machine for quality inspection and assurance in factories. Put simply, it’s meant to address DNB’s aspirations for smart factories that harness 5G. CREDIT’s solution, Digital Twin Mavi Box Hub with 5G, detects defects from a manufacturing hub’s production line in real time. Did you know: A digital twin is a computer programme that uses real-world data to create simulations that can predict how a product or process will perform. It’s also trained to identify and raise alerts if it detects health, safety, security, and environmental issues in factories. When paired with a CCTV, or placed on a drone that autonomously flies within the manufacturing plant, all data is fed to a digital twin model to be analysed. Outside of factories, the Digital Twin Mavi Box Hub with 5G is being used in Malaysia’s search and rescue missions during flood relief. “Apart from that, we are working with several palm oil plantations for yield monitoring and health, safety, security, and environmental issues with the same technology,” Narendran added. The three winning teams received RM10,000 cash prizes from MYStartup, and the opportunity to deploy their solutions within DNB’s 5G ecosystem. According to Nanderan from CREDIT, his team’s solution may soon receive investment opportunities, which could assist them in building a prototype, and having an eventual market launch. If your startup has an idea you’re hoping to build and grow, you can join MYStartup’s community to find corporate partners, resources, and programmes for every stage of your startup journey.

Multimedia Super Corridor Malaysia (MSC) was an early initiator in this paradigm shift, driven by the Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC). MDEC is reported to have contributed to the growth of our digital economy efforts which currently stands at 22.6% of the total GDP. More recently, the Malaysia Digital Economy Blueprint (MyDIGITAL) has played a role in the country’s digital adoption, which was spurred by the pandemic. Now, MDEC believes we are in a new state of change and has rolled out a new plan to accelerate the country’s digital economy, and it’s called the Malaysia Digital (MD) initiative. MD is an initiative by MDEC to converge digital sectors with the economy. To do so, it will advocate and promote the universal use of digital solutions in all economic activities. Via MD, stakeholders involved will be opened up and given access to digital tools, knowledge, and income opportunities, as part of the enhanced initiatives planned for the programme. MSC will be transformed into MD, which aims to position Malaysia as a globally competitive digital nation. Thus, MD’s framework will see a refresh of the Bill of Guarantees, non-location-based incentives, and an expansion of locations for promoted activities, amongst other things. Speaking to Vulcan Post, MDEC’s CEO, Mahadhir Aziz explained that the expansion of location-based activities is in reference to the previous boundaries MSC had set for its framework. Back then, the companies under MSC were mainly based in Cyberjaya. “With MD, we aim to expand digital hubs across Malaysia and are working together with various state governments to do so,” shared Mahadhir. Some of the other initiatives that will take place under MD include something called DE Rantau. It is intended to establish Malaysia as the preferred Digital Nomad Hub within SEA by boosting digital adoption and promoting digital professional mobility across the country. DE Rantau aims to benefit both local and foreign talents via the creation of a proper ecosystem to support digital nomads. “Digital nomads will be able to regain the work-life balance, feel safe while on holiday-working across various locations in Malaysia, have access to stable broadband connectivity, as well as other facilities and services which support the nomadic lifestyle,” elaborated Mahadhir. MDEC’s CEO believes that the DE Rantau programme will \\u200b\\u200bhave a spill-over effect on the economy, as it has the potential to benefit the local tourism industry too. Another programme under MD will involve the country’s digital trade, seeing that COVID-19 has fast-tracked Malaysia’s digitalisation opportunities. MD aims to capitalise on this traction and further involve other businesses in transitioning to digital activities. “This programme will drive interoperability and greater harmonisation of standards and regulatory approaches and facilitate trade within Malaysia and across borders,” added Mahadhir. It will also seek to standardise data exchange for efficient payment and collection through e-invoicing. As mentioned earlier, MD will become the enhanced MSC. Hence, all 2,794 active MSC-status companies will be absorbed into MD, without needing to reapply. For context, MSC has a cumulatively generated revenue of RM588 billion and RM212 billion in exports as of December 2020, according to MDEC. With the launch of MD soon, it will not affect the incentives being enjoyed by the existing companies, or applications that have been made by them. “Those will be evaluated and processed as per current guidelines and procedures, which will remain status quo until further notice,” Mahadhir made clear. “In the meantime, existing Cybercities, Cybercentres, and Digital Hubs will continue to provide ready infrastructure and a conducive business environment for MSC-status companies as well.” MD is set to provide businesses with agility, flexibility, and relevance to the current market trends through a range of incentives and support. “We are confident with the new offerings as well as various impetus programmes to grow the ecosystem, Malaysia will compete with the best and this can only be good news to all our existing and soon-to-be MD-status companies,” Mahadhir shared. Mahadhir firmly believes that Malaysia possesses a multitude of benefits for foreign direct investments to land and expand into the wider ASEAN region. Hence why MDEC is committed to driving Malaysia’s digital economy forward via various initiatives and programmes. Speaking about Malaysia’s current digital economy development, Mahadhir stated that the country is now at a critical juncture in growing the digital economy. “On one hand, businesses, especially SMEs and MSMEs, cannot afford to not digitalise, as they risk falling behind,” he shared. At the same time, Mahadhir acknowledged that the digital economy landscape has changed so much over the past two years. Now, massive changes are needed for Malaysia to remain competitive. We have the capacity and capability, but we need to ensure we stay competitive with flexible, agile, and relevant offerings; hence, the introduction of Malaysia Digital as a successor programme to MSC Malaysia.

Then in 2021, there was a sudden shift and we found ourselves home to 3 unicorns, namely Carsome, AirAsia Digital, and edotco Group. But does this really mean that Malaysia is poised to grow more unicorns? From the responses we’ve seen to the MyDIGITAL blueprint, there’s still a lot of scepticism over whether our government agencies can actually hit the outlined goals. For a brief introduction, some of MyDIGITAL’s goals include creating 5K new companies, growing or attracting 5 unicorns, and digitalising 875K MSMEs and SMEs by 2030. During a panel discussion at Wild Digital SEA 2021, we had the pleasure of listening to Gopi Ganesalingam, Chief Digital Industry Officer at Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC), and Rafiza Ghazali, Group CEO of Cradle Fund explain MyDIGITAL’s goals in more depth and address several questions from the startup community. The session was moderated by Dash Dhakshinamoorthy, founder of accelerator StartupMalaysia, who shared his own input throughout. Did you know: In 2013, the term “unicorn” came into being thanks to Aileen Lee, founder of Cowboy Ventures, a seed stage venture capital firm. Unicorns are used to describe startup companies that are valued at US$1 billion, and they’re usually tech startups. As of November 2021, CB Insights reported that there are more than 800 unicorns around the world. Gopi took the virtual stage first, stating that unicorns are important not just by definition, but because of what they represent. They’re larger companies, which are important in any ecosystem. “And if you look at unicorns, the spill-over effect is the job creations, the supply chain—the ecosystem a unicorn brings together.” He later quoted a Startup Genome report that revealed a unicorn increases the value of an ecosystem by 10x. Editor’s Note: The sentence above has been edited to reflect Gopi’s intended statement more accurately. Rafiza pitched in with her own two cents, stating that unicorns could also inspire budding entrepreneurs and growing startups to keep going. Hearing this, Dash likened it to how humankind sending a few people to the moon helped grow the world’s aerospace industry. Prior to MyDIGITAL, Gopi admitted that government agencies involved in the startup ecosystem tended to work independently, albeit being just a phone call away from one another for any discussions. But now, the blueprint has united these agencies to leverage each of their strengths to create the desired “right” ecosystem for breeding unicorns. It’s no longer just each agency chasing its own KPIs, instead, they’re coming together in pursuit of a national goal. Rafiza agreed, saying that though she’s technically the new kid on the block, she’s been observing Malaysia’s startup ecosystem for a long time and feels as though this is the first time that she’s seeing all the agencies really communicating and working with one another. Based on the speakers’ sharing, it appears that funding is not a concern as both MDEC and Cradle Fund said that the government has been putting in a lot of effort to ensure the ecosystem is well-funded. Just last year, Penjana Kapital was incorporated as a government company to operationalise the Dana PENJANA Nasional (DPN) programme. By June 2021, it had raised RM850 million, exceeding the target of RM288 million by 3.7x. Of the total raised, 55% was also from foreign investors. Other government agencies are also trying to promote Malaysian startups going abroad and outside venture capitalists (VCs) coming to Malaysia. Dash brought up that in his discussions with several startups over the pandemic, he learnt that they felt talents were scarce and costly to acquire. Without talents, it’d be nigh impossible to breed our unicorns. What then could be done to address this issue? Just shy of disagreeing, Gopi clarified, “I joined MDEC in 2015 and I’ve always noted the fact that Malaysia has lots of talent, whether that’s entrepreneurial talent or talents that support entrepreneurs.” “Malaysia is a small country, but if you just take one sector like the banking and financial institutions, if you go out of ASEAN, a lot of the major players that support the banks are Malaysian companies.” So, the truth of the matter is that we produce good talent, but we don’t retain them very well. We also don’t retain our entrepreneurs very well. Coming back to the blueprint, that is exactly what it is trying to address. Rafiza also supplied, “We have the talent, but they’re not necessarily in Malaysia.” Despite this, she’s had people reaching out to her to learn how they could contribute to and support Malaysian agencies and companies while overseas. From this, she concluded that because everything is now digital, talents don’t necessarily have to be in Malaysia to get involved in our ecosystem. Adding on to this point, Gopi said, “So, you can get talent from anywhere, even the best talent—if you can afford them—through any platforms.” He’s also aware that some larger companies were now beginning to pay a lot more for fresh graduates, giving good candidates an incentive to stay. That’s according to Gopi, on behalf of MDEC. In essence, the MyDIGITAL blueprint is akin to a report card, and MDEC, Cradle Fund, and other agencies are working to hit the targets in it. On the other hand, Cradle Fund has its own 3 metrics that it’s been closely monitoring for each of its grant recipients. First would be the job creation potential of each recipient, and secondly, Cradle Fund looks at a startup’s potential for further funding to assess its longevity. Rafiza was glad to share that out of all the Sendirian Berhad companies they’ve helped so far, 8/10 are still around. Thirdly, they look at a company’s contribution to the GDP. Rafiza shared that the organisation’s track record shows that the job creation multiplier for every grant recipient stands at a minimum of 7.36x (even excluding the gig economy and Grab, whom Rafiza called an “outlier”). Meanwhile, for every Ringgit of a grant provided by Cradle Fund, a recipient’s GDP contribution is multiplied by 3.35x. “So, for every RM500K [in grants], we get a GDP contribution of RM1.5 million,” Rafiza said. As of now, a lot of information about and for Malaysian startups is greatly fragmented. To compile a list of every Malaysian startup in existence or figure out how to launch your own Malaysian startup, you’d likely have to sift through tons of sites without full assurance that you’re fed the right information. This is why Cradle Fund was allocated RM20 million to start the MYStartup platform which should address these pain points. It will be a collaborative platform that public and private agencies can pitch in to share data. “It will save time for startup founders to focus on running their business and will allow them to find IP lawyers, investors, support, mentors, jobseekers, etc.,” Rafiza added. By the end of November, we could expect to see an MVP of the site. On MDEC’s part, the agency has already been running a variety of programmes to close the gap between itself and startups. Some examples include the 22 Digital Hubs, working with accelerators to hold hackathons, fundraisers, Founders Grindstone programmes, and more. Gopi said that they’ve seen results with all these, so MDEC will continue to develop and enhance such initiatives. The sharing in this panel by Gopi and Rafiza definitely gave more context to and insights into why Malaysia is pursuing the creation of unicorns, and how it plans to do so. I think we are poised to really catapult the ecosystem and build not just more unicorns but resilient, global, investable, quality startups. We have the talent, we have the people, we have what it takes, all the secret recipes to build the ecosystem. So, it’s just whether or not we have the heart, soul, and faith to execute all these. Now, the Malaysian startup ecosystem and its stakeholders will wait with bated breath to see how all the goals laid out will be executed. What results will we see over the next 4-9 years?

This initiative was appointed by the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation (MOSTI) which has also selected former MaGIC CEO, Dzuleira Abu Bakar to head this department. Officially launched in April 2014 by former Prime Minister Najib Razak and former US President Barack Obama, MaGIC has played a significant role in growing the startup ecosystem in Malaysia. Until today, MaGIC is often credited as a great support system for budding startups in and out of Malaysia. Thus, we decided to take a look back at who its leaders have been, what they’ve done as MaGIC CEO, and what they’re up to now. Founding CEO, Cheryl Yeoh Sew Hoy, was head-hunted to lead the USD$30 million (according to her LinkedIn) government-funded innovation programme. Cheryl herself is a Malaysian entrepreneur who launched a startup, Reclip.It in New York. The platform matched users’ shopping lists with digital coupons and eventually made it in Silicon Valley, leading to an acquisition by Walmart Labs, the investment arm of the US retail giant. As CEO of MaGIC, Cheryl played a role in creating all the agency’s programmes from scratch, building a team of 75 full-time employees and 25 interns within 2 years. Cheryl’s leadership also birthed MaGIC’s Global Accelerator Programme (GAP), which has continued on till today and is now raising its 5th cohort. She also spearheaded Distro Dojo with 500Startups, a growth-stage accelerator that funds startups with USD$100-250K. Educational and networking programmes were also created by Cheryl to build the angel and VC community in Malaysia. This was able to help the local startup ecosystem bring in funds and investors from China, Japan, Singapore, and Australia. Cheryl stepped down in January 2016 after her contract period with MaGIC ended. However, it was also rumoured that her leaving the agency came after months of mounting pressure on MaGIC to reach out to entrepreneurs of all types, not just tech-based ones, reported Digital News Asia. In spite of that, the same source also highlighted that Cheryl accomplished what she’d set out to do: put Malaysian startups on the world map. Since then, she hasn’t slowed down in impacting communities and growing entrepreneurs around her. Returning to the US, she became the Chief Marketing Officer at San Francisco-based coding bootcamp, Hack Reactor between June 2016 to March 2017. The company was later acquired by Galvanize, a software engineering education platform, partially financed by its US$32 million Series C funding round in 2018. Simultaneously, Cheryl served as an Independent, Non-Executive Director from 2016 to 2018 on Flexiroam Limited, an Australian-based telecommunications company. In 2017, Cheryl spoke out about her sexual assault by 500 Startups founding partner, Dave McClure. Her courage for speaking out was recognised and she was listed #13 in TIME’S “2017 Person of the Year,” as one of the 61 women featured in the magazine’s “Silence Breakers”. The list highlighted women who’ve spoken out against sexual harassment in the workplace. Following the release of her account, Cheryl established the #MovingFoward public directory in March 2018. \\u200b\\u200b#MovingForward is an open-source directory with an aim to help founders know their rights and have a clear way to report harassment and discrimination. \\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200bBy October 2020, it had grown to 175 firms in 24 countries participating in this movement. Cheryl is currently an entrepreneur-in-residence at Silicon Valley Bank and the co-founder of healthtech startup, TinyHealth. It offers microbiome tests that provide insights into a pregnant mother and her baby’s gut health during conception to prevent chronic health risks later on. She’s also an advisor to various startups including blockchain infrastructure company Tendermint, the team that built Cosmos Network and Kenzie Academy. Ashran Dato’ Ghazi was selected as MaGIC’s new CEO in May 2016 to succeed Cheryl Yeoh. He’d also been an entrepreneur prior to this position and co-founded JOOT Ventures in 2011. The startup’s social networking site Joota managed to garner private investments of US$2.1 million, with patent and distribution partners in the US. In addition, he has served as an advisory board member to the Malaysian SME Development Academy as well as a board member for SME Corp. During his tenure as MaGIC’s CEO, Ashran helped expand MaGIC outside of the Klang Valley to also involve Sarawak. The agency built a co-working facility in Kuching and called it Borneo 744. Its main objective was to grow entrepreneurship within the immediate community and serve Kuching’s startup scene. Ashran also helped bring GAP to the global stage with the inclusion of more foreign startups. To combat the under-representation of females in Malaysia’s startup ecosystem, he also launched an initiative titled the Pre-Accelerator Bootcamp: Female Founders Edition. In July 2017, \\u200b\\u200bhe launched MaGIC’s Impact Driven Enterprise Accreditation (IDEA) initiative. IDEA was created to recognise and promote enterprises that created a positive impact within their respective communities. Since stepping down as MaGIC’s CEO in November 2018, Ashran has moved on to focus on the consumer intelligence firm, Dattel Asia Group (Dattel), as its CEO from January 2019 till the present. Dattel is a consumer intelligence and data analytics company, with a mission to democratise data and make good quality data and analytics accessible to the masses. Since this move, it appears that Ashran has still remained committed to nurturing talents and helping the local startup scene. To help organisations capture and analyse data in a better way, Dattel launched a global consumer intelligence challenge called IDEAHACK. It was a competition aimed at bringing in inter-disciplinary talents to find new perspectives, ideas, and tech-based solutions. Noticing entrepreneurs struggling with the abrupt shift in consumers’ behaviour due to the COVID-19 outbreak, Dattel launched UPLIFT Malaysia. It was an initiative to empower 10,000 businesses with actionable insights on the latest consumer behaviour through an RM50 million data fund. Much like her predecessors, Dzuleira is no stranger to the entrepreneurship ecosystem. As a seasoned VC, she was once the CEO of Cradle Seed Ventures (Cradle), a growth stage venture capital fund. Dzuleira was appointed for the role of MaGIC’s CEO in April 2019. Her case is a bit out of the ordinary because she technically is a past MaGIC CEO, but because of the consolidation of TPM and MaGIC, she’s back on the latter’s leadership board. While heading MaGIC as the agency’s CEO in 2019, she managed to achieve notable milestones. In just 2 years under her leadership, the organisation achieved RM760 million in total value creation, impacted 26,327 participants via its various programmes, and secured 5 international partnerships, to name a few examples. Through Dzuleira’s leadership, MaGIC played an important role in coordinating the implementation of the National Technology and Innovation Sandbox (NTIS). NTIS \\u200b\\u200bis the national solution coordination centre that allows innovators and startups to stress-test their business models and delivery mechanisms in a secure and live environment. This is possible because NTIS allows for some relaxation from all or selected regulatory requirements. Through the 2020 PENJANA initiative meant to help stimulate Malaysia’s economic recovery from the pandemic, Dzuleira led the creation of MaGIC’s Social Impact Matching Grant (SIM Grant). The grant was aimed at helping social innovators to sustain their initiatives and programmes via a 1-to-1 grant matching mechanism for successful crowdfunding initiatives. In April 2021, Dzuleira was appointed by MOSTI to lead MaGIC’s merger with TPM to establish Malaysia’s very own Silicon Valley. This move is part of the government’s larger efforts to restructure and consolidate its agencies to ensure that they are well-positioned to execute the MySTIE 10-10 framework. In its years of operation, MaGIC has achieved a value creation of RM409 million, organised 294 programmes, accelerated 189 startups, and created 690 jobs, according to a report in 2020. Recently, the agency has also launched The Malaysian Research Accelerator for Technology and Innovation (MRANTI). Formed through the MaGIC-TPM consolidation, the soft launch of the new agency by MOSTI combines the hardware and the software needed to accelerate Malaysian innovation to commercialisation. With the country set to develop startups to drive Malaysia from its current production-based economy into a knowledge-intensive one, building the right ecosystem to grow and cultivate innovations will be a strategic move in reaching this goal. Seeing that the MaGIC-TPM merger is meant to do exactly that, all eyes will be on Dzuleira as she leads the government agency in achieving the goals set on the MyDIGITAL blueprint.

They can either be homegrown or foreign startups, according to the MyDIGITAL blueprint. In recent news, however, newly appointed Minister Dr Adham Baba of the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MOSTI) reiterated that the ministry is aiming to create 5 unicorns in the next 5 years. Furthermore, Dr Adham Baba stated that this target can be achieved through the incorporation of the 10-10 Malaysian Science, Technology, Innovation, and Economy (MySTIE) Framework, which came out in 2020 when Khairy Jamaluddin still led MOSTI. It’s an ambitious goal for sure, seeing that Malaysia has so far only found one unicorn in Carsome, which hit its US$1 billion valuation milestone in July 2021. To recap from our previous article on unicorns: Unicorns are hard to build in Malaysia for a variety of reasons, such as our smaller population, a lower standard of living compared to countries with unicorns, and companies lacking the money to pay top talents. This makes creating 4 more unicorns in the next 5 years a tall order, so we had to find out how MySTIE can aid in the hunt for Malaysia’s next unicorns. Simply put, MySTIE lays out certain factors to identify a startup with high potential to drive Malaysia from its current production-based economy into a knowledge-intensive one. And it’s likely that MOSTI will derive its potential unicorns from those who fit the bill. By looking at 10 identified science and technology (S&T) drivers alongside 10 essential socio-economic sectors, it hopes to enhance the competitiveness and sustainability of Malaysian industries. In return, it should also improve the quality of life of its citizens. These identified S&Ts and socio-economic industries were derived through a study conducted by the Academy of Sciences Malaysia (ASM) in 2015. Researchers based their conclusions off the Emerging Science, Engineering, and Technologies (ESET) around the world, which includes the use of: Meanwhile, the socio-economic sectors that are in focus for development by adopting these S&Ts are: An example of the MySTIE application can be seen in transitioning the agriculture and forestry sector from a labour-intensive one to being more technology-driven with agritech. This can be seen in how Bao Sheng Durian Farm applies 5G to harvest ripe durians, and how farmers are using drones to analyse data on soil conditions, provide fertilisation, and more, for better yield. MySTIE also encourages the convergence of technologies that facilitates the transformation of each sector. This, in turn, creates a multiplier effect on other socio-economic drivers. For instance, modernising the agriculture sector can contribute to a vibrant agritourism industry, hence providing a lucrative revenue stream. While in the energy sector, agritech can facilitate the generation of renewable energy from biofuels. MySTIE has also laid out the factors that would make a startup fit this bill called the National STIE Niche Areas. It involves a company possessing 8 ecosystem enablers (like human capital and internationalisation potential) to enhance the value of socio-economic sectors. For a company to fit into MOSTI’s identified National STIE Niche Areas, a company needs to have: Once these businesses have been identified, MySTIE will deploy projects to address the needs of communities and their quality of life. The mechanism comprises 6 steps starting with educating businesses on the 10 S&T drivers and how they impact the business’s core operations and influence the chosen socio-economic areas. It will finally end with future-proofing a business where regular foresighting is conducted to ensure the business is adapting to change and is able to mitigate risks. After learning about MySTIE, it does showcase a more detailed plan in helping Malaysia achieve its forecasted goals under MyDIGITAL and subsequently, finding the nation’s next unicorns. As for who could potentially be Malaysia’s next unicorn, a startup like Aerodyne seems to be a solid contender. Though its valuation is currently undisclosed, it’s already been listed as a minicorn with a total funding US$47.29 million. Editor’s Note: Information in the above paragraph has been edited to reflect greater accuracy. To elaborate, Aerodyne is a provider of SaaS and AI-based drone services. The data collected by drones is processed by AI-based proprietary software in order to offer actionable insights. These services already check MySTIE’s S&T boxes of advanced intelligent systems, along with augmented analytics and data discovery. Catering to the oil and gas, power, telecom, renewables, construction, agriculture, and infrastructure sectors, it also checks at least 3 of MySTIE’s identified socio-economic drivers. On top of that, the dronetech startup operates across multiple locations like Australia, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, the USA, UAE, Chile, and Indonesia. That being said, there are a lot of other candidates as well, and the right support that goes beyond monetary value will be necessary in order for our minicorns to evolve.

Whether for a solo adventure, a family holiday, or a group trip, it’s in our nature to hunt down deals that can lower the final amount on the checkout page. If you’re currently searching for flight discounts, BigPay has one for its users. Starting today until the end of 2023, BigPay is offering up to a 5% discount on airasia flight bookings. This is done in collaboration with airasia to encourage more group travel. Hence, there is no cap on how many times you can utilise this promotion. To use the deal, you’ll have to key in the promo code, ‘BIGPAY5’ when searching for a flight booking via the airasia superapp or the airasia website. Scenario: When you apply BigPay’s 5% flight discount to your flight from Kuala Lumpur to Bali which would initially cost RM2,692 for four pax, you’ll only be paying RM2,592, which is a savings of RM100. Currently, the discount is not applicable to AirAsia X flights, but this may change in the near future. As part of the collaboration, BigPay users can also get other benefits while travelling, such as earning airasia points whenever you pay or make international transfers with BigPay. Whenever you spend with your BigPay card during your trip, you’ll earn airasia reward points, too. These points can be used to redeem discounts on accommodation, transportation, meals, and more, from participating service providers. Having said that, if you’re already a frequent BigPay user, you can use the earned points from your most recent trip to redeem discounts and reduce travel expenses for your next getaway.

So, we put that to the test.', 'body': '[This is a sponsored article with Teleport.] Sending things to friends and family abroad can be an inconvenience due to hefty shipping rates, potential delivery delays, and more. Thus, going through such a process is usually only reserved for important occasions or emergencies, like for a family member’s wedding you can’t attend, or sending aid to someone. But what if we could easily ship packages abroad regardless of the affair? Teleport, the logistics arm of Capital A (formerly AirAsia Group) has launched a new service to address this demand. Named Teleport Pink, it leverages AirAsia’s network of flights, and promises users affordable international next-day deliveries. Teleport Pink is first offering deliveries from KL to Singapore, and plans to expand the service to other SEA destinations like Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines in 2023. So, we tested it out by sending our team in Singapore a little gift, something they wouldn’t be able to get from their country. To help us get the ball rolling, Teleport Pink’s team sent us a few parcel bags for our KL to Singapore delivery. The bags can be purchased directly from Teleport Pink’s online store, or from participating myNEWS outlets, and certain vending machines, along with co-working spaces such as Common Ground and WeWork. Each parcel bag costs RM1, and carries a max 5kg load. All Teleport Pink parcel bags come with instructions on how to use the service. They also have a unique QR code that leads you to the brand’s website to fill in a digital form for your delivery. You’ll have to input details like your and your recipient’s names, addresses, contact numbers, along with a brief description of what the package contains (documents, attire, food, etc.). No printing or drop-offs are required whatsoever. Payment can be made via credit or debit card at the checkout page, and one-way delivery fees are fixed at RM40 (or S$15) per package. A word from our sponsor: Customers sending their first parcel get a free delivery promo code “PINKFREE”, which the receiver in Singapore will also get upon receiving the parcel. Teleport Pink has made its parcel bags easy to reuse as well. As the original QR code is printed on a sticker, receivers may peel it off to reveal another unique QR code, and ship the package back to their sender, or anyone else in KL. It’s worth noting that Teleport Pink’s next-day deliveries only apply to parcels that are picked up before 4PM. Placing a delivery order on Wednesday, November 16 at 12.40PM, a Teleport rider came by to pick up my package at 1.38PM. The parcel’s instructions also stated to not seal the bag. This is so packages can pass through customs quicker, as they’re checked by a Teleport representative beforehand. So, I watched as the Teleport rider peeped at my package’s contents before sealing the bag in front of me. A little intrusive, but perhaps that’s the cost of convenience and speediness. This definitely alleviated a concern I had about my package getting rejected by customs though, since it contained a perishable item. When asked about what kinds of things would be rejected from the parcel, the Teleport courier said that those include drugs, explosives, and the like. Generally, anything that would be flagged when you send your bags through airport customs. From there, I wished the parcel a safe flight on its trip to Singapore as it boarded with other AirAsia passengers. You won’t be able to track your orders via a moving rider icon on a map as your parcel makes its way to the destination. Instead, Teleport Pink will send you live updates via SMS when the parcel has reached its final destination. You can also see these updates on Teleport Pink’s tracker page when you enter your parcel’s code. At 3.50PM on Thursday, November 17, I received messages from both Teleport Pink and my colleague in Singapore that the package had arrived safely. One special gift we included in the package was coffee beans from the Malaysian brand, Gigi Coffee. It was something we personally enjoyed during our visit a couple of months ago, and we hoped that our Singapore team could share the sentiment, too. Something interesting happened when my colleague received her package though. Her delivery guy came in a Lalamove Van. Reaching out to Teleport Pink, the team explained that its delivery chain comprises a combination of Teleport’s own fleet, along with third-party service providers. This is to ensure that parcels are delivered quickly as (pinky) promised, while enabling the brand to expand its coverage and scale its volume efficiently. Safe to say, Teleport Pink’s service lived up to its word. When it comes to affordability, Teleport Pink’s fee of RM40 to deliver a package from KL to Singapore is arguably on the higher end, as courier aggregator sites list options that cost under RM30. Taking into account the “next-day” factor of Teleport Pink’s service, though, the price is justified. Cheaper options would require a waiting period of up to a week. Teleport Pink’s next-day delivery is a service that provides instant gratification to both the sender and receiver. Using it, gifters won’t have to worry about if or when their package would reach their receiver, with the constant SMS updates and swiftness of the delivery. More than consumers, Teleport Pink will be valued by businesses as well, especially ecommerce ones with customers rushing to get last-minute gifts for their international peers. Plus, if buyers had to return an item to the seller, Teleport Pink’s parcels make it easy to do so via the second QR code. For now, Teleport Pink is in its infancy stage, and only time will tell what the pickup rate of this service will be. Living in a world today where convenience and speed are highly valued though, Teleport Pink is equipped to serve a market that’s willing to pay the price.

The basic requirement is to get a drone competency certificate, otherwise known in the industry as a Remote Pilot Certificate of Competency-Basic (RCoC-B). The RCoC-B is like a driver’s licence for a remote pilot. This certificate is introduced to ensure drone flyers in charge of their UAV understand the regulations, operating requirements, and procedures for safely flying these drones. There are also more in-depth courses, including RCoC Module 1 (EVLOS), and RCoC Module 2 (Agriculture). This certification entails both theory and practical training, and requires prospective remote pilots to pass a written and practical exam. Here are six Malaysian drone academies offering classes so you can get certified with the CAAM. Located in Selangor, Aeronerve is a Malaysian drone-based remote sensing service provider operated by Technerve Technology. Aeronerve’s training course will go through all the necessary knowledge and skills in drone operation and its common applications. Its syllabus is also updated with the latest input regarding the UAV laws and regulations from locals and international authorities. The courses offered at Aeronerve are designed and delivered by certified professional drone pilots, who are experienced in drone operating missions and also in drone-related businesses.

Regardless of your answer, this can now be a reality, as airasia food has just rolled out such a service. Launched on August 15, the food delivery arm of the airline will now allow Klang Valley residents to get freshly-made food from selected Penang merchants delivered to them that’s prepared on the very day of delivery. The catch, though, is that your food can only be delivered on the Wednesday of each week, and with an order cut-off time being before 5PM on Tuesdays. No, it’s not going to cost you the price of an airplane ticket, as the delivery currently has a starting fee of RM5.99 per order. Based on recent coverage, it seems like sentiments towards this service are generally optimistic. However, we couldn’t help but feel a tad skeptical. Interested in finding out how this service will perform for ourselves, we made a bundle order of three duck egg char kuey teow from Tiger Char Koay Teow, Penang. Our delivery slot is currently scheduled for Wednesday, August 17, between 5 to 5.30PM, and while waiting for it, we thought we’d first expand on our current thoughts about it. So, here are some questions we have about the service. According to airasia’s news release, all meals will be prepared fresh before they’re air-flown to KL. A regular food delivery service already takes up to an hour from when food is cooked fresh, to when it reaches a customer’s table. Putting it on a flight would require several more hours, and many more steps. After it’s cooked, it has to be packaged securely enough to withstand turbulence, get sent to the airport, board the flight, fly for roughly an hour from Penang to KL, get unpacked, and then spend another hour on the road to reach a customer’s doorsteps. The whole process could take at least four to five hours, and that doesn’t even take into account bad weather, traffic, or flight delays. Since the food won’t be frozen, we’re wondering how fresh can the dishes be kept throughout this longer-than-usual delivery duration. Will the noodles still be springy? Will the sauces have dried up? airasia hasn’t fully revealed how they’ll be accomplishing this feat, so it remains to be seen what our food will look like once it arrives. Depending on the merchant, food can sometimes be badly packaged, whether due to a merchant’s carelessness or a factor that’s out of their control. Add on to that fact that airasia will be bringing food upon a flight where turbulence is inevitable, and where air pressure while flying will cause packages to expand, and one has to wonder: will our food really survive the journey? This could be circumvented by using special packaging, whether as an additional layer by airasia, or by merchants themselves (who might have to secure such packaging from airasia itself). In the event that the packaging breaks and spillage occurs during any part of the journey, we wonder what kinds of safeguards have been put in place by airasia. Have merchants been instructed to make backups that will also be sent on the flight as a precautionary measure? Does airasia intend to refund customers? Or is this why customers can only order in a bundle of three (minimum) as we had to do with our meal from Tiger Char Koay Teow? airasia will make its first round of deliveries this Wednesday, August 17, which is when our own food should arrive as well. As we’re currently promised a delivery slot between 5 to 5.30PM, it would make sense for the AirAsia flight to arrive by 4PM if it was going to make it to our Bangsar South delivery location on time. That’s a 50-minute drive from KLIA2. The closest time we were able to find was a flight arriving at 2.45PM tomorrow. This would give the food enough time to arrive at our doorstep in a timely manner, assuming they have to go through the usual check-out processes on flights. Of course, there is also a possibility that the food will be flown in along with other cargo deliveries with a different schedule altogether. It is not known if airasia will be limiting the number of orders each merchant can accept, since cargo space in each flight has to be accounted for. If there is an order limit per flight, and the uptake for this service takes off, it then makes sense as to why airasia is allowing customers to schedule their orders up to 30 days in advance. At launch, there are nine merchants available to order from, including Hameed Pata, Bangkok Lane, Jeruk Madu Pak Ali, Nyonya Kuih from Li Er Cafe, Nasi Kandar from Hameediyah, and White Curry Mee, amongst others. The airline is also calling for more Penang merchants to join the offering, since it aims to give these businesses more visibility to airasia Super App users across the region. If the ball is in the merchant’s court to go the extra mile in packaging their dish to be cargo safe, we wonder if airasia will incentivise them for the extra costs and labour involved. (Or, are we the market validation…? Hm.) With airasia delivering Penang food to Klang Valley, it suggests that KL folks will get to satisfy their cravings without having to travel themselves, saving on flight tickets and associated travel costs. However, cravings aren’t exactly a planned affair, and most people would want to scratch that itch immediately. While pre-ordering a few days ahead would still make sense, pre-ordering a month in advance doesn’t. To add, cravings are usually very personal, and with airasia making customers buy their dishes in a bundle, you’d need to get friends or family onboard, or finish up the food over a few meals. It’s also worth noting that there are some Penang merchants on airasia’s list that already have outlets in Klang Valley. For instance, Nasi Kandar from Hameediyah has outlets in Kota Damansara, Ampang, and KL. Jeruk Madu Pak Ali also has branches in Puchong, Shah Alam, and Batu Caves. We couldn’t find the Klang Valley outlets for both these restaurants available for delivery on airasia food, but they are listed on GrabFood, which is still a quicker option than ordering from Penang. In this case then, why would a customer willingly pre-order meals from these outlets in advance, and wait at least a day or more for delivery? airasia’s popularity in its early days came from it challenging the status quo of who gets to fly, opening up the leisure travel sector to everyday people. However, over the years, we’ve observed that it began to slow its roll. When rolling out its food delivery and e-hailing services, one could even say they were late to the party. Previously, Tony Fernandes said of their ride hailing strategy, “I’ve got eight years of Grab doing it to learn from. I don’t have to waste all that money, with experimentation, building technology, training drivers and training the market how to order, they have done it all for me.” Although, with airasia’s pilot drone deliveries (though there’s been no further news of it since) and now its intercity food deliveries, we have to say, there is something to admire about the company’s guts in rolling out experimental services. This intercity food delivery service is also smartly leveraging existing airasia resources and infrastructure to elevate its regular food delivery service. Regardless of whether there is demand for intercity food deliveries, the airasia Super App has been known to launch new services fast, gain customer feedback, and continuously refine their ideas. From what we can see, this intercity food delivery service is still rather rudimentary, if our driver “Testboy 1” with car “ABC123” is of any indication. Nonetheless, we’re still quite stoked to see how our food will arrive, and we’ll definitely be writing about our experience, so stay tuned for updates!

As part of its commitment to giving delivery riders a better working environment and job stability, the recent employment news intends to enhance income opportunities. airasia’s initiative is coming in as a timely one as well. The Star reported that a delivery rider strike is happening as of today (August 5), due to the lack of job security and unstable income. Riders are asking for fair wages to compensate for their extended time and effort on the road to make up for the rising cost of living. “As many people know, gig riders do not have anyone protecting their interests as it is not regulated and sometimes results in suppressed wages and almost no welfare benefits,” Regional Head of airasia food, Tan Suan Sear, told Vulcan Post. “We want to do the right thing by being ahead of the industry. We want to provide surety of income and enable our delivery riders to carry out their duties safely and confidently.” Claiming to be the first in Asia to transition its gig workers into full-timers, airasia food and airasia xpress riders will receive a base monthly salary of RM3,000. Based on performance, riders can also earn extra incentives. This is in addition to a full suite of Allstar benefits. This will include EPF, SOCSO, medical coverage (covering spouses and children as well), annual leaves, travel benefits, and free personal accident coverage, amongst others. There will also be career advancement opportunities across the entire Capital A organisation, the team told us. “We don’t believe in contract staff and will now move towards employing all riders as full-time employees, receiving the same benefits that every Allstar receives,” CEO Tony Fernandes said in the press statement. Being full-time employees, riders will have to clock in a minimum of eight hours according to their duty roster. Any additional orders completed will be part of their extra incentives as well. “All riders’ activities will be tracked via the airasia Super App, which will give us a better understanding of its riders’ job take-up rate, performance, location, and other data that will help them complete their jobs better,” added Suan Sear. The position is currently available to those in Klang Valley and Penang. It also offers an option for riders to join on a freelance basis where they will be paid according to trips. As freelance riders, they will be compensated as per the number of orders completed per day. Currently, airasia has a fleet of over 20,000 riders registered on its platform regionally, according to Suan Sear. Having already onboarded 20 permanent riders, the team will begin converting all its delivery riders into full-time employees while welcoming new ones to join. airasia made clear during its press conference that it has no intention of limiting the number of applications. Head of delivery, Lim Ben-Jie said at the launch event that the company will have a proper screening process before hiring the riders. New riders joining as full-time riders will also undergo rider training and a three-month probation period. The management team will evaluate each Allstar based on their performance in tandem to set targets and goals throughout their probation period. Because airasia will be paying each rider a base salary of RM3,000 a month, how will this affect its customers? When probed, Suan Sear shared that airasia is expecting an improvement in completion rates and better services for its customers. “Each rider will be professionally trained with the same level of quality as every cabin crew in our airline business to ensure that our riders deliver the same quality of service to our app users who order food or parcel deliveries,” he explained. With full-time employment and guaranteed income, the team believes riders will no longer need to endure dangerous working conditions to fulfill ridiculous amounts of deliveries to earn enough. “Now, they can deliver and meet their targets with safety and confidence,” Suan Sear hoped. When asked if the delivery fees would be hiked up to afford airasia’s full-time riders, Suan Sear implied that this cost would be borne by the company. “While operational costs will increase in the short-term, we are actually investing in our people, which we believe will bear fruit in the long term as they grow as Allstars,” he said. While airasia may be the first to transition its gig workers into full-timers, GoGet Malaysia was likely the first to provide gig workers EPF through its app. It’s encouraging to see more companies that base their business models around gig workers take the initiative to offer them some level of job security. The strike by delivery riders mentioned above is a way of giving companies some awareness about the effects gig workers feel towards coping with the rising cost of living, and airasia’s efforts in improving these conditions are commendable.

International travelers would be required to have valid travel documents to enter and exit the country, and those fully-vaccinated need not undergo any quarantine. However, they would have to take a Covid-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test two days before departure, and a professional Covid-19 Antigen Rapid Test (ART) within 24 hours after arrival in Malaysia. For those who are not fully vaccinated, or unable to receive the vaccine due to health reasons, Malaysia’s health minister will share further Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) on this tomorrow. Additionally, travelers will no longer need to apply via MyTravelPass, but would still be required to download the MySejahtera mobile app for contact tracing purposes. “Taking into account the Omicron variant which is still in our country and other countries, there are some mandatory steps for both Malaysians and travellers,” he said. The minister also previously said over the weekend that the reopening of borders will allow people to meet during the Hari Raya Aidilfitri celebrations in May. The international border reopening would include Malaysia’s land checkpoints with Singapore, and both the Johor Causeway and Second Link at Gelang Patah would be reopened simultaneously.

I’d opt to whip out my debit card and flash my QR code because I found these methods to be more convenient, transactions were faster, and I could avoid a bulky wallet. When Visa Malaysia sent us their study on Malaysian consumer payment attitudes, I found myself being part of a 60% of Malaysians that have gradually shifted to relying more on cashless payment methods, across several types of services. Note: The survey had 1,000 respondents between the ages of 18 and 65, all of whom had an income of at least RM2,000 through full-time, part-time, or self-employment. The respondents hail from all over the country, including East Malaysia. I wanted to see if the people in my own circle experienced this exact shift and I got my colleagues at Vulcan Post to share how and why their own payment preferences have changed. Despite what I had initially thought, cash is still widely used, but following closely are contactless methods such as online card transactions, mobile wallets, and contactless card (Tap to Pay) methods at physical terminals. This year, contactless methods saw an increase in usage frequency compared to 2020, while cash saw a 4% dip in use. The Vulcan Post team likely contributed to this shift because all nine of my colleagues tell me they’d rather use cashless methods. But also in line with how cash is still widely used, we still carry some in our wallets. Planning for 2022: With more establishments set to offer cashless payment options next year, look out for cashless payment deals by merchants who want to incentivize further adoption. There are usually seasonal discount codes or one-use bonuses. However, it’ll be unlikely that cash will be dislodged as an important payment method next year, so you’d still need to queue at the ATM. With that said, the Ringgit bills mostly stay put until very specific situations call for them. Our business development executive Rikco, editorial writer Joycelyn, and video producer Matt only use cash when paying for food at kopitiams or roadside snack stalls, while our video editor Fadhilah uses cash to pay for grub and petrol. This is reflected in Visa Malaysia’s survey again as dining and petrol are two areas in which we use cash the most during the pandemic. Meanwhile, some of the categories in which Malaysians use the most contactless payment methods include grocery shopping, bill payments, and entertainment. A number of my colleagues agree with this but they pointed out that this was a norm for them even before the pandemic. We pay our utility bills using apps anyway, and buying movie tickets online is, at times, a necessity in order to reserve our seats early. This is an ongoing trend too as over 50% of Malaysians see bill payments and shopping at supermarkets as activities that don’t require cash anymore. Hence, it’s likely this will remain unchanged in 2022. Planning for 2022: Before making any purchase, find out what is the best optimised combo which uses the best shopping platform, e-wallet and payment cards in order to maximize savings and rewards. For example, certain credit cards allow you to unlock higher cashback tiers the more your spend in order to maximise returns. Or, buy an item on an e-commerce website using your e-wallet which you’ve reloaded using a credit card, and receive points on both platforms. The Vulcan Post team found that our spending patterns have largely been unchanged compared to pre-COVID times. In fact, some of us are spending even less thanks to less driving and more home cooking, for example. Apparently, Malaysians prioritize convenience above all other factors when choosing payment methods. Interestingly, the survey claims that we consider cash to be a very convenient option, but contactless cards and QR payments rank higher. But to put into perspective how little we’ve been relying on cash of late, more than half of the survey respondents have successfully gotten by without spending physical money for a week or longer. Beating out more than 500 Malaysians is Sade, our managing editor who only uses physical currency around once every few months. In fact, she prefers tap-to-pay and QR methods while shopping in stores. If you think she hates using cash, our business development manager Venxhin has walked away from making a purchase because the merchant didn’t offer contactless options. Both of them share the same reason for going cashless: cards and e-wallets simply offer more convenience. Besides not needing to count individual bills before paying, ditching cash also means you spend less time visiting and queuing up at ATMs. With less cash, you reduce the frequency of coming into contact with potentially contaminated bills, another plus. The survey ranks hygiene high among the factors that help shape our preferences during this pandemic. Plus, those who frequently use credit cards and mobile wallets do so to take advantage of the rewards system too. With all those reward points, vouchers, and deals collected, digital payment methods can keep a loyal user base. You add to that the benefit of convenience and cleanliness, e-wallets, and contactless cards should remain popular well into the future. Planning for 2022: Visa Malaysia anticipates a rebound in travel as over half of Malaysians are keen on travelling domestically within the next year. If you’re one of the 33% of Malaysians planning to fly overseas, make use of your credit card to rake up travel miles, which will come in handy when more countries open their borders within the next year. In 2022, we can possibly look forward to more people opting to use e-wallets and mobile contactless (NFC). These methods saw a jump in usage frequency this year compared to the last. Contactless card payments are also popular as seven in ten users signed on to the method since the onset of the pandemic. But its growth in adoption has stagnated since 2020. I reckon one of the reasons causing this is the resurgence of cash in an increasingly immunised society. As markets and eateries welcomed back patrons through the last few months, cash regained its importance. However, convenience and hygiene will still be highly sought-after benefits in the post-pandemic world. We could therefore even see the rise of biometric payment methods in the near future. There’s a growing interest among Malaysians in using biometric payment methods, such as face recognition or finger scans.

This, in turn, slowed down the treatment process for patients at the clinic as well. Then came the endemic in 2021, where Malaysians returned to the workplace, students went back to school, and tourism sectors revived. To manage the risks of the virus’s spread, most premises began requiring visitors to present a negative result of self-tests done at home. “Test kits, especially saliva kits that users buy from pharmacies are exactly the same as what the doctors are using in the clinic,” Dr. Chan said. However, self-tests may not be accurate as most are conducted privately and aren’t authenticated by licensed medical professionals. If test kits find themselves in the hands of users with malicious intent, this also creates an opening for results to be manipulated. Confident that he could make COVID-19 screening safer, easier, and more effective, Dr. Chan gathered a team and invested RM500,000 capital to launch CLEA in 2021. The app is a virtual COVID-19 screening platform where users can verify and authenticate their self-tests by medically qualified doctors. After signing up on CLEA with your IC and phone number, you’ll begin the Virtual COVID-19 Screening (VCS) which requires 1 credit (RM15 per credit) to use. The whole VCS process has 6 guided steps from the registration process to the submission of your results. You’ll first be asked to choose which Rapid Test Kit (RTK) you’re using, between saliva, nasal, or whistle tests. CLEA has a partnership with Gmate, so purchases of its RTKs come with a complimentary VCS credit. Otherwise, any Medical Device Authority (MDA) approved self-test kits from pharmacies work too. Step 2 is preparation, where you’re prompted to prepare the self-test kit, a permanent marker pen, and to ensure that you have no less than 30% of battery left in your phone. This is because the whole test process may require up to 30 minutes, and cannot be interrupted at any time. You’ll then verify your identity by taking a photo of both sides of your IC, along with a selfie. A unique TAC code is then provided for you to write its number on the cassette you’re using. It’s important to ensure your handwriting is readable and that the ink of the pen is dark enough to be seen via your phone’s selfie camera during the recording. You’ll then be guided on how to properly frame yourself and the test materials in the recording, which will begin after these instructions. Upon starting, users must present the labelled cassette on camera. You are given 20 minutes to perform the test, from depositing saliva into the tube, shaking it, up until dropping the sample onto the cassette. The recording automatically ends once 20 minutes have passed. Most RTKs require a 15-minute wait time, and once the results appear, you’ll take a picture of it on CLEA’s app and submit it along with the video recording. Though CLEA states that medical professionals will verify your submitted materials within 24 hours, I got mine within 90 minutes. Once verified, users will be issued certificates that can be used as entry passes to any premises that require screening test reports. Personally, I had my doubts about CLEA’s system, as I believed that self-tests were subject to user error. But after going through the whole process and understanding how CLEA’s unique TAC and QR codes verify results along with the timestamps of tests, I’ve been reassured. Furthermore, if CLEA’s partnered professionals deem any part of your sample collection process inaccurate, your results may be marked as invalid and you’ll have to redo the test. Of course, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests still remain the gold standard in diagnosing COVID-19 with an accuracy close to 100%. But Dr. Chan assured that home test kits have accuracy rates above 90% and have been evaluated by institutions like the Institute for Medical Research, Hospital Sungai Buloh, University of Malaya, etc. He also stated that the most vital part of performing a screening is the sample extraction. “Not everyone knows how to collect a proper sample, be it saliva or nasal, so this is where CLEA plays a role in ensuring the users are collecting the correct samples by our panel clinics,” he shared. With the correct sample collection method, the whole screening process performed by users themselves can be as accurate as performed by a medical professional. When determining the cost of the credits needed for the app’s VCS, CLEA’s team prioritised making it as affordable as it can be for users, while finding a way to compensate doctors’ time. “This is no easy task but we eventually set a price around a Starbucks Grande Caramel Frappuccino Blended Coffee,” Dr. Chan said. “And we managed to figure out a sweet spot for all our panels as well.” In addition, CLEA’s platform is also equipped with a HR management portal, allowing employers to regularly monitor their employee’s last screen date and COVID-19 status. This will allow companies to pre-plan their workforce needs with data from the management portal, thus reducing unnecessary disruptions in workplace operations due to an outbreak. In turn, employees are able to start work immediately upon arrival without having to go through the hassle of multiple manual on-site screenings. The service can also be extended to high-traffic premises that are vulnerable to the spread of forming COVID-19 clusters such as schools, events, hotels, and malls, to name a few. In terms of the fees for business packages, CLEA determines them on a case-by-case basis, depending on the frequency of the screening and volume. As of now, CLEA has more than 54,000 app downloads, 50,000 active users, and 30 corporate clients which include Jaya Grocer, Healthland Wellness, and Uncle Chang Sipadan Resort. Because CLEA is an endemic-related service, Dr. Chan’s focus is to scale and introduce this platform to more users or even countries who are in need of it. Although using CLEA requires extra fees and a longer period of time before confirming RTK results, some may deem the costs worth it. This is so they can ensure that the quality and results of the test are legit and accurate. After all, not everyone holds the same ethics and civic awareness to perform a new test for every new occasion they attend. Some might even recycle old test pictures, compromising the safety of everyone around them. Thus, CLEA can be a valuable solution when it comes to minimising the risk of having such a person in a social circle, especially for businesses that cannot afford to have operations further disrupted by irresponsible individuals.

This may be due to the growing acceptance that tangible things in this world are moving into a more digital reality, or the envisioned metaverse, largely catalysed by COVID-19. NFTs in Malaysia are most often linked to the arts industry, but they can be used for much more, as we’ve previously written. They have utility functions too, and MinNature Malaysia (MinNature) is attempting to lower the barriers to entry in their usage by allowing visitors to purchase entrance tickets (the NFT) through cryptocurrencies. This digital shift by the team came into effect after struggling through 18 months of lockdowns, where the only viewers of MinNature’s sculptures were the four walls of its gallery. MinNature is an art exhibition showcasing about 34,000 miniature replicas of different sculptures in Malaysia spanning its 1,207 sq. metre gallery space. Trivia: Its Dataran Merdeka centrepiece cost about RM80,000 to build. It first opened in Summit USJ in 2016 where the exhibition was oriented towards the children and family market. On March 3, 2020, MinNature relocated to JUMPA at Sungei Wang Plaza, in the heart of KL’s Golden Triangle, and reinvented itself to be a beacon of Malaysia’s culture and heritage. There, they hoped to target more tourists and adults. Speaking to Vulcan Post, Wan Cheng Huat, founder and curator of MinNature Malaysia said, “After spending a considerable large amount on marketing, promotion, KOLs, and billboards for our grand opening, our team was looking forward to this brand new start for MinNature.” “But little did we know what was in store for us.” Within 2 weeks of reopening, the MCO came into force, and the tourism industry came to a halt. What many hoped to be just a couple of weeks in lockdown turned into months, and morale continued to take a plunge. The team realised that their dreams to reopen MinNature may not happen as cash reserves hit zero, with no end in sight to the lockdowns. “At some point during the lockdowns, I had to reach out to my mum and siblings to help cover my monthly finance commitments and even put my home up for sale,” Cheng Huat shared in our interview. But as he found no buyers, his home was not sold off. “Personally, as the founder, I was so devastated. No words can describe that feeling accurately. I was already on the verge of giving up.” Knowing that they couldn’t control the government’s plans, the team decided to refocus their energy to be part of a 3D printing initiative to aid the frontliners. Participation was able to relieve them of some unwanted thoughts about their situation at the time. Multiple pivots were also attempted to bring in income for the business, from hosting paid virtual walks to selling customised miniature products online, and offering model-making services. The team also tried selling vegetables and durians to make some money. Cheng Huat recalled that these initiatives were not easy to plan and execute, especially after the team that grew from 8 members to 60, was cut down to 2 during MCO 2.0. “The saddest part of the MCO was that we had to lay off all of our team in October 2020. We exhausted whatever reserves we had initially allocated pre-MCO,” he said. One of the ways MinNature’s team stayed active throughout the MCO despite its closed exhibition doors was by venturing into the metaverse. A free session they hosted was the MinNature 360 experience, where viewers could explore the gallery and its miniature wonders. It was the team’s way of getting user feedback on the acceptance of their metaverse project. “We wanted to know how viewers felt when exploring a 360 view of MinNature, what their expectations were, and whether it was a viable option to venture into,” Cheng Huat elaborated. “From that survey, it led us toward the metaverse exploration and development to complement our existing offerings.” But their metaverse plans aren’t just a jump onto the bandwagon. Even prior to 2020’s lockdowns, Cheng Huat said they already saw the potential of incorporating metaverse-related technologies like AR into their products to make them more appealing. In fact, MinNature was already conducting immersive projection mapping on its miniatures to develop its own AR app, but development was halted due to the MCO. “We are now working on plans to raise funds and restart development again, with a focus to explore the implementation of MinNature metaverses and NFTs. It’s where people can come in to explore MinNature digitally and even buy our miniatures collections as NFTs,” Cheng Huat said. As part of the above adoption, the gallery has started accepting cryptocurrencies via its ticket sales. Because there are no “fixed prices” when it comes to crypto and NFTs, visitors will pay the crypto value equivalent to the Ringgit value of the ticket, and payments are made with cryptocurrencies XRP or USDT. To drive adoption and user rates for this payment method, the team is also running promotions for those who pay via crypto. Furthermore, MinNature has launched its first series of NFTs called “MinNature Official–Mini in the Glass Wall Collection” on Opensea. “We believe that with a balance of both a digital and physical gallery, it will enable us to reach untapped markets and expand,” Cheng Huat hoped. The whole idea of the metaverse and NFTs being used as currencies in it is so that people can essentially “own” digital assets. MinNature’s sculptures of tiny buildings, roads, and infrastructure present a physical and tangible way to understand the metaverse concept, in my opinion. “The possibility to own a piece or the entire miniature building or sculpture will be realised through our NFTs. This unique physical pairing use case for our NFTs is under development.” MinNature has also successfully hosted paid live virtual walks which it intends to keep as an ongoing programme in the coming months. This will expand its reach to all kinds of visitors, perhaps even overseas ones who can’t visit it in person. So even if the next MCO happens, we see it more as an opportunity to implement our new ideas. For MinNature, we have already passed the worst part of the MCO and we are moving ourselves forward even if another lockdown is imminent.

Singapore and Malaysia’s vaccinated travel lane (VTL) will be launched from Nov 29. Both country’s Prime Ministers announced in a joint statement today (Nov 8) that the VTL will be between Changi Airport and Kuala Lumpur International Airport. The reopening, however, only covers air travel. It does not include land travel via the Causeway or Second Link. A post shared by Vulcan Post (@vulcanpost) “The Prime Ministers also look forward to restoring travel across the land links between both countries in the near future,” the statement read. In a Facebook Post, Singapore’s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong noted the good progress in each country’s efforts to vaccinate their population and manage the pandemic. “So we agreed that it is timely to progressively resume cross-border travel between both countries. This will help revive our economies, restore people-to-people ties, and strengthen our bilateral partnership,” Mr Lee said. Both Prime Ministers noted that there are ongoing detailed discussions on a similar vaccinated travel scheme and to reopen travel across the Causeway and the Second Link, while taking into account the public health situations in Johor and Singapore. So far, Singapore has VTLs with more than 10 other countries, including South Korea, Australia, and the United States. All travellers entering Singapore under the VTL scheme do not have to serve a stay-home notice, but will only need to take a Covid-19 polymerase chain reaction test before departure and upon arrival. Prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Singapore-Kuala Lumpur air route was among the busiest in the world. On land, about half a million people made daily trips between Singapore and Johor before borders were shut in March last year.
